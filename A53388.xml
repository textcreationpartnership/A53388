            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>GREAT SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have here undertaken to draw the Picture of a Perſon that once was inveſted with the Stile, Title, and Dignity of a King, and certainly he might have been the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in his time, could he but have complied with the ends of his great Office in this Nation, to which he was admitted, and with the obſervation of the Laws of the Realm, to which he was ſolemnly Sworn, according to the Cuſtoms and Conſtitutions thereof at his Coronation. I did never in my whoLe life take him to be the Wiſeſt of Men; nor did I believe him to be ſo much behind-hand in Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but that he muſt needs know, That as Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was Originally inſtituted by the Great God himſelf, and this or that Form of it, choſen and ſubmitted to by Men, for the Peace, Happineſs and Security of thoſe who
<pb facs="tcp:56278:3"/>
are Governed, and not for the private Intereſt and perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Greatneſs of them that Rule; ſo that Government hath been always eſteemed the beſt, where Supream Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates have been inveſted with the Power and Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives that might capacitate them not only to preſerve the People from Violence and Oppreſſion, but to promote their Proſperity, and yet where nothing was to belong to them by the Rules of the Conſtitution, that might enable them to Injure and Oppreſs them.</p>
            <p>This unhappy Prince, was a long ſtander by in his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Reign; from the Year 1660, to 1685; and Experience and the Informations of wiſe Men, without all doubt, taught him, That it had been the Glory of <hi>England</hi> above other Nations and Countries where his Brother and he had Travelled, that its King hath had all Intruſted with him that was neceſſary for the advancing the welfare of the People, or for his own Protection in the diſcharge of his Office and ſupport of his Dignity and Grandure, and withal ſtood ſo limited and reſtrained by the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental terms of the Conſtitution, that without the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his own Oath, as well as the Rules and Meaſures of the Government, he could do them no hurt, nor exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe any act of Authority, but through the Adminiſtration of ſuch hands as ſtood obnoxious to be Puniſhed in caſe they Tranſgreſſed: So that according to the true Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive frame of the Government, the Prerogatives of the Crown, and the Rights and Privileges of the Subject were ſo far from juſtling one another, that the Immunities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved unto the People, tended to render the King Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and Great; and the Prerogatives ſettled on the King, were in order to the Subjects Protection and Safety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56278:3"/>
Notwithſtanding all this, it is well known to your Moſt Excellent Majeſty, that in the two laſt Reigns there was a diſmal and an unaccountable alteration of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment attempted by this Prince and his Popiſh Accomplices, and the moſt excellent Monarchy endeavoured to be changed into an abſolute <hi>French Tyranny:</hi> For tho our Religion and Liberties were fenced and hedged about by as many Laws as the Wiſdom of Men could deviſe for our Preſervation, from <hi>Popery</hi> and Arbitrary Power; yet our Religion was in thoſe unaccountable Reigns Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by Popiſh Counſels, and our Privileges raviſhed from us by the Fraud and Violence of the two laſt Kings, who were in a continued Conſpiracy againſt the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, and the Rights of the People of <hi>England,</hi> of which your Majeſty may take a full Account in the following Memorial.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs to Your Majeſty, that to diſcant on the Misfortunes of a Perſon that is fallen from ſo high a Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and is reduced to a State that is next to Death, is neither a thing that I coveted or deſig'nd, tho I was a great Sufferer by him both in his Brother's and his Reign; but the Inſolency of his wicked Conſpirators that are here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, hath ſo provoked me, that I cannot in point of Duty that I owe to God and Your Majeſty, forbear letting the Nation know what we muſt truſt to if ever that Man ſhould return again and Reign over us.</p>
            <p>This preſent Conſpiracy againſt Your Majeſty and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, hath not only provoked me to publiſh the Arts and Methods of the late King, uſed for the deſtruction of our Laws, Liberties and Religion, in conjunction with the Popiſh Party, but it hath encouraged me to Dedicate
<pb facs="tcp:56278:4"/>
the ſame to your Royal Name and Patronage, and to no other, becauſe I am well aſſured, it will not only juſtifie the truth of the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> for the diſcovery of which I have undergone a fierce Fiery Tryal, out of which I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by Your Majeſties coming to Save us, when we were even upon the brink of Ruin and Deſtruction; the ſenſe of which hath created in me an undelible Love and Loyalty to Your Majeſty and Government; and I queſtion not, but that Your Majeſty will Pardon the Human Frailties that may appear in this Memorial in the manner of my expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Truths therein Contained.</p>
            <p>The Villainous Party, againſt whom I now Write, have uſed many Arts and ways to traduce your Majeſty and Government, meerly becauſe you promote the Grandure of your People, and the Eaſe and Welfare of your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, rather than intrench in the leaſt upon any of their Immunities and Privileges; ſome of whom would be thought to be good Proteſtants; but their late Conſpiracy to Aſſaſſinate Your Majeſty, ſhews them to be very Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Rebels to your Majeſty and Government; and it proves that Party to be obſtinately reſtleſs, and never be brought to Reaſon by Mercy and Clemency. How little therefore theſe Criminals will deſerve from Your Majeſty, the World will better judge, if they will but conſider how Graciouſly Your Majeſty hath dealt with them, ever ſince Your happy Acceſſion to the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Crown of this Realm, to the very day that their wicked Purpoſes were diſcovered to Your Majeſty. I have ſeen ſome of the very ſame Spirit, careſſed by ſome that were about You, whiſt your real hearty Friends were Slighted and Aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. Nay, I ſhall be ſo plain to ſay with truth, that
<pb facs="tcp:56278:4"/>
your Majeſty hazarded the Hearts and Affections of your beſt Subjects, and much of your Royal Honour, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niving at the Carriages of theſe Men, though with fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to win and oblige, if poſſible, theſe everlaſting holy Cut-throats.</p>
            <p>But Sir, what Arguments of Clemency and Grace can perſuade ſuch Men to be true to your Majeſty, their Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Lawful King, maintaining the Laws and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of your Subjects, ſince they profeſs an Allegiance out of Conſcience to a contrary Sovereign, who deſtroy'd our Laws and Liberties, and made them ſharers in his many Deſigns and Conſpiracies againſt us? Or how can your Majeſty expect Truth and Sincerity from theſe Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, where Treaſon and Lies are Virtues and Merits? You have in this Tract many Tragical Inſtances within freſh Memory of their Wicked Purpoſes and Deſigns; look back but to the beginning of your Majeſties Reign, ſince which time your Majeſty cannot but remember how many Proofs they have given out of their own Mouths of their more than Villainous Diſaffection to your Majeſty and Government, and Trayterous Intentions againſt your Royal Perſon, both at Home and Abroad, nay, before your happy Acceſſion to the Throne. I may, without offence to your Majeſty, take notice to you of your being abandoned by King <hi>Charles,</hi> in Compliance with the <hi>French</hi> King, at the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the then Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and his Popiſh Adherents; and not only ſo, but your Ruin and Deſtruction, when you only had the Title of Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> was deſigned by the Popiſh Party; my Affection and Reſpects to you then, though wholly a Stranger to your Perſon, made me then diſcover the Conſpiracy againſt you, but none of the
<pb facs="tcp:56278:5"/>
Council took any notice of what related to your Self, but Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Arlington,</hi> and another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Peer, who, I ſuppoſe, did tranſmit the ſame to you when in <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But bleſſed be God your Majeſty as a Monument of the Mercies of the moſt High, is once more delivered out of their Hands, and in your Deliverance we that have Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed you are delivered; and we queſtion not but you will remember to diſtinguiſh between thoſe that have teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their Sincere Loyalty to your Majeſty, and thoſe that have openly appeared Traytors to your Royal Perſon and Government, and queſtion not, Great Sir, but that God who hath now ſo Miraculouſly delivered you, and in whoſe hand are the Hearts of all Kings and Princes, will fully Convince your Majeſty of all the unworthy Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of your ſecret Enemies, and of my Integrity too, how ſtrange ſoever they have endeavour'd to repreſent me to your Majeſty; till then, with all Patience and Humility, I ſhall commend my Cauſe to the All-ſeeing Judge, with a Reſolution to perſevere through his Aſſiſtance in my Truth, Integrity and Loyalty, againſt all Diſcouragements, or Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, or Neglects, or Blandiſhments either, to my laſt gaſp.</p>
            <p>What Peace can theſe Brutes have in their Souls and Conſciences, that do ſurrender their Liberties and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Mercy of a Perſon that would have inſlaved them, and being through the Mercy of God to us, driven out from theſe Kingdoms for his Tyranny, he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can nor will he own them, if he were to return. It is ſtrange to any thinking Man, that of theſe Conſpirators, who profeſs the Proteſtant Religion, that they ſhould not conſider the whole Series or Courſe of Life of that preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:56278:5"/>
King, for whom they venture Body and Soul, hath been a continued Conſpiracy againſt them and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Why ſhould they not ſit down and conſider his Contriving the Burning of <hi>London;</hi> his inſtigating a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy with <hi>France,</hi> and two ungodly Wars with <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> his fomenting the Popiſh Plot, and contriving the Murther of Juſtice <hi>Godfrey,</hi> to ſtifle it; his forging of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt Proteſtants, and ſuborning Witneſſes to ſwear the Patriots of our Religion and Liberties, out of their Lives; his hiring execrable Villains to Aſſaſſinate and Murther the Great Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and cauſing ſeveral others to be clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinely Murthered in hopes to conceal it; his adviſing and procuring the Prorogation and Diſſolution of Parliaments, in order to prevent inquiry into his Crimes, ſo that he might eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the Juſtice of the Nation? Why ſhould not theſe Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Profeſſors remember his Poyſoning the King his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in order to his Invading the Throne; his Murdering <hi>Algernoon Sydney</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> upon the Depoſition of one ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Witneſs, and the cutting off the late Loyal and Brave Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> and Murdering him for Crimes alledged againſt him, in reference to which, if all had been Truth which was ſworn againſt him, yet there was nothing that according to Law could have reached his Life?</p>
            <p>Give me leave, Great Sir, to acquaint your Majeſty, that none murmured more againſt the Proceedings of the late King than the Proteſtant Jacobites did: I can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how confounded they were when he began his Reign, with a bare-fac'd avowing himſelf of the Romiſh Religion, and calling into the Nation a multitude of Prieſts and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, and empowered them to Exerciſe their Idolatries: Nay, who were ſo much concern'd as ſome of theſe Men,
<pb facs="tcp:56278:6"/>
and in my own hearing, have owned that he was ill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to trample upon thoſe Laws which concern our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, ſeeing that by two Proclamations, whereof the one required the Collecting of the Cuſtoms, and the other, the continuing the Exciſe, which was to expire at King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Death; he violently, and againſt all the Laws of the Land, broke in upon the Eſtates of many of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England;</hi> and they did own that the ſeven or eight ſuborn'd and forſworn Judges, that countenanc'd him in doing ſo vile a Thing ought to have been hanged; and they have often ſaid, that if he proceeded thus he would ſoon bring the Kingdom about his Ears, and he muſt take it for his pains: How can theſe Men look Mankind in the Face, who have been in a barbarous Conſpiracy, for the reſtoring of a King that had thus acted in oppreſſing his People, and for the Murdering of your Majeſties Perſon, that had delivered the Nation from theſe Oppreſſions?</p>
            <p>When I reflect upon the Reign of that late King, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be filled with the greateſt Horror, to think that there ſhould be a number of Men left in <hi>England,</hi> that ſhould ſo much as attempt his Reſtoration, when they well knew that he had precluded his Subjects of all hopes of Redreſs in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> and deprived us of all Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour where our Anceſtors found it. I thought that all Men would have joined with your Majeſty to have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the late King <hi>James</hi> a Tyrant, Traytor and Murderer, and all that did adhere to him ſhould have been treated as Banditti and Freebooters, and not as Gentlemen and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Men; but inſtead of this, that in the compaſs of ſeven Years, behold two or three Conſpiracies againſt your Majeſties Perſon and Government, detected and proved,
<pb facs="tcp:56278:6"/>
and yet theſe People will ſcarce ſo much as bluſh at the ſelf-contradicting Carriage of themſelves and Party.</p>
            <p>Some of theſe Proteſtant Jacobites have been at St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,</hi> and then they muſt Experience the late King's uſage of his Proteſtant Friends there; and if a certain Writer may be depended upon, their uſage is hard and ſevere; firſt he denied them a Proteſtant Chappel and Chaplain; nay, if a Proteſtant be any thing zealous for his Religion, they want not <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts to ſwear a Plot upon them, and ſo they are confined notwithſtanding their Quality, and the ſignal Services performed for their pretended King. Many Inſtances might be given of this nature; and a reaſonable Man might have judged that the many Inſtances of thoſe Slights and Contempts that have been put upon them, ſhould have convinced them of the Folly and Madneſs of any of thoſe that pretend to the Proteſtant Religion and Church of <hi>England,</hi> who ſhould Eſpouſe the Cauſe of a Man that hates their Religion and Liberties. Can they think that the preſent Misfortunes that the late King <hi>James</hi> lies under, would, if he ſhould be re-inveſted with Power, frighten him to alter his Meaſures and Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of invading our Laws and Liberties for time to come, ſeeing, that neither the abandoning of Wives, Children and Eſtates, nor the hazarding, nay, loſs of Life in his Service, can render him juſt and favourable to thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, who have made a Sacrifice of all theſe things to follow him, and yet that theſe Men ſhould be found in ſo Villanous a Conſpiracy, to Murder him that delivered the Nation? What Tongue can ſpeak for ſuch brutiſh and ſenſleſs Wretches, I muſt leave to the Judgments of wiſer Men than my ſelf. And what can they expect from
<pb facs="tcp:56278:7"/>
a Man whoſe Father's Misfortunes, his Brothers Exile, wherein he himſelf was a ſharer, have not wrought a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in him? Can we expect that ever he will be more cautious of violating our Laws, intrenching upon our Liberties, or ſubverting our Religion; or that ever he will be made more pliable? For if he denies Men that have followed him into <hi>France,</hi> the Exerciſe of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, what hopes have they of obtaining and enjoying it, whenever he ſhall return? Nay, what then muſt your Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects expect, who have renounced him, and aſſociated to defend your Majeſty, as our Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Rightful King, againſt this pretended King and all his Wicked and Trayterous Adherents?</p>
            <p>But Sir, give me leave a little further to plead with your Majeſty concerning theſe People, that certainly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver give themſelves leiſure to think; I am ſure no Man in his right Wits but muſt judge it the higheſt degree of Stupidity and Folly, that theſe very Men ſhould expect good Terms from a Perſon who doth not only treat his Proteſtant Adherents very ill, who have followed him in his Misfortunes, but alſo whoſe Religion lays him under the neceſſity of uſing them thus. What Obligations did our Church lay upon him when he was a Subject? Did ſhe not, like a Proſtitute, ſave him from being Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the Popiſh Plot, and from being Excluded from the Succeſſion to the Crown? Who were ſo Hot in that point on his behalf as the then Prelates in the Houſe of Peers, and afterwards from being driven out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth?</hi> yet all thoſe Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations were of no more value with him than his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation-Oath, which he violated without the leaſt regret,
<pb facs="tcp:56278:7"/>
and ſpared not to invade the Proteſtant Religion in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but the Liberties of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
            <p>What wicked Traytors are theſe wretched Men, that ſhall aſſiſt the Popiſh Party in their attempts to pervert the Church, and to bring that about in effect which even to mention, makes every Loyal Subject of your Majeſties to tremble? For certainly had theſe Conſpirators been all of them avowed Papiſts, your Majeſties Perſon and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment had not been in that danger; but ſome of them that have undertaken this Horrid Deſign, are ſuch as lye under no Temptations of Religion; Men thought to be ſecure; that theſe, now the Myſtery of Iniquity is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, are found Men obliged by all the Sacred Ties of Malice and Ambition, to aſſiſt in the advancing your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Ruin, and the Ruin of the three Kingdoms; and much better qualified than others, under the Name of Good Church of <hi>England</hi> Men; nay, Preachers of Paſſive Obedience and Non-Reſiſtance will not be ſhut out of this Helliſh Conſpiracy for Wranglers, but will have a hand againſt your Majeſty's Perſon, rather than ſo E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent a piece of Service ſhall go unperfected. Give me leave therefore Sir, with the greateſt Duty and Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to obſerve to your moſt Excellent Majeſty the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of that Religion they would ſubvert, by ſhewing the Vileneſs of that they would introduce, and the happy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment they would deſtroy in the attempt they have made upon your Majeſty's Perſon.</p>
            <p>Theſe Conſpirators that ſay they are Proteſtants, cannot but own that we are exceeding happy in relation to our Religion, ſince by your Majeſty's happy Acceſſion to the
<pb facs="tcp:56278:8"/>
Throne; that we are once more freed from the <hi>Romiſh Yoke,</hi> which ſo great a part of <hi>Europe</hi> do yet draw and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under; that Popery is ſuch a thing as cannot but for want of a Word to expreſs it, be called Religion; nor is it to be mentioned with that Civility which is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe decent to be uſed in ſpeaking of Differences of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Opinion about Divine Matters; were it open Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm, or plain Turciſm, or honeſt Paganiſm; there is yet a certain <hi>Bonafides</hi> in the moſt extravagant Belief, and the Sincerity of an Erroneous Profeſſion may render it more pardonable: But this Popery is a Compound of all the three, an Extract of whatſoever is moſt Ridiculous and Impious in them, incorporated with more peculiar Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of its own, in which thoſe were deficient, and all this deliberately contrived, and knowingly carried on by the Raſcally and Villainous Clergy, under the Name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. The Wiſdom of this fifth Religion in this laſt and moſt Inſolent Attempt upon the Credulity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy againſt the Liberty of Mankind, ſeems to all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Men, principally to have conſiſted in their owning the Scriptures to be the Word of God, and the Rule of Faith and Manners; but wickedly prohibiting at the ſame time their common Uſe, or the Reading of them by thoſe of their Communion, there being no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or more rational way to fruſtrate the very deſign of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, (who firſt planted by the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Power and extraordinary Gifts of the Holy-Ghoſt) than to forbid the uſe of them in ſuch a Language as the People could underſtand; for having the Scripture, which by all Chriſtians are avowed to be of Divine Authority, but appointing it to remain in ſuch hands as were intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
<pb facs="tcp:56278:8"/>
to undertake and carry on their holy Cheat, they had the Opportunity to vitiate, ſuppreſs, or interpret, to their own advantage, for the ſupport of their Villainous Prieſtcraft, thoſe admirable Evidences, by which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People hold their Salvation; and they having by this Fraud gained their Point, there was from that time nothing ſo monſtrous to Reaſon, and ſo abhorring from Morality, or ſo contrary to Scripture, which they might not in prudence venture on. The Idolatry of Adoring and praying to Saints and Angels, and worſhipping Pictures, Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and incredible Miracles, and palpable Fables, to promote that Veneration. The whole Liturgy and Worſhip of the bleſſed Virgin, the ſaying of <hi>Pater Noſters</hi> and <hi>Creeds,</hi> the Honour of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Ave-Maries</hi> too, not to her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but of others. The Publick Service, which they can ſpare to God among, ſo many Competitors in anun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Tongue, and intangled with ſuch Veſtments, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrations, Exorciſms, Whiſperings, Sprinklings, Cenſings, and Phantaſtical Rites, Geſticulations and Removals, ſo unbecoming a Chriſtian Office, that it repreſents rather the Pranks and Ceremonies of a Jugler or a Conjurer: The refuſal of the Cup to the Laity, the neceſſity of the Prieſts' Intention to make any of their Sacraments effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, debarring of their Clergy from Marriage, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting of Meats, Auricular Confeſſion, and Abſolution, as with them Practiſed; Penances, Pilgrimages, Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. But above all, their other Cheats and Rogueries, in the Villainous Soleciſm of Tranſubſtantiation, whereby that Glorified Body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which at the ſame time they allow to be in Heaven, is Sold again and Crucified daily upon all the Altars of their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
<pb facs="tcp:56278:9"/>
for God indeed may now and then do a Miracle, but a Raſcally Prieſt of their Synagogue can, it ſeems, work in one moment a thouſand Impoſſibilities; and this by a new and Anti-ſcriptural Belief, compiled of Terrors to the Phancy, Contradictions to Senſe, and Impoſitions on the Underſtanding. The Laity of their Communion have turned Tenants for their Souls, and in Conſequence Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butaries for their Eſtates, to an abominable nonſenſical Prieſthood.</p>
            <p>But I confeſs my ſelf under great Obligation to do their Synagogue right, and I do humbly acknowledge to your Majeſty, that out of an equitable and vaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ble Conſideration and Recompence of ſuch a religious and faithful Servitude, the Prieſts have quitted and diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the People of all other Services and Dependence, and given them full and perfect liberty from all Duty to God or Man, inſomuch that thoſe of the Clergy, who have been more learned, and the managers and directors of their Conſciences, have ſo well inſtructed them in all the moſt villainous Arts of circumventing their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and of making a Jeſt of Heaven; that were their Diſciples as apt as their Spiritual School-maſters, there would for ſome Ages ſince have been a Period put to all true Piety, and common Honeſty, and no other Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments remaining with them, but authoriſed Hypocriſy, Licentiouſneſs and Knavery, had not the natural Worth of the better ſort, and the good Simplicity of the meaner, in a very great meaſure preſerved them; for truly nothing but an extraordinary Temper of Soul and that too aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Divine Influences of the Grace and Spirit of God could poſſibly reſtrain thoſe within any Terms, or
<pb facs="tcp:56278:9"/>
bounds, or laws of common Humanity, who at the ſame time receive the Doctrin of their Caſuiſts as the Oracles of God, and own the Authority of the Grand Impoſtor at <hi>Rome</hi> to be of Divine Right, as it is by him claimed and exerciſed. This Man of Sin by his pretended Indulgencies ſays, That he delivers the Souls of thoſe that are of his Communion, out of the pains of the other World: So that what Man is he that believes that Doctrin, that would not pleaſe his vicious Appetite, that hath ſo good a Security? He, by his Diſpenſing Power annuls Contracts between Man and Man; diſſolves Oaths between Princes, and of Princes with their Subjects, and gives Allowance in Caſes which God and Nature prohibits. This Impoſtor and deceiver of the the Sons of Men, as a Clerk of the Eccleſiaſtical Market, hath ſet a Rate upon all Crimes, the more villanous they are, and the deeper their dye, and abominable, the better Commodities, and the Votaries advance in the Price as for greater Rarities: So that the worſe they are in their Morals, the better Cuſtomers they are to a lewd Prieſt; juſt as if God had publiſh'd his holy Commandments on purpoſe to erect an Office for the Conſcience-mongers of that curſed Synagogue. And thus that Strumpet enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth her Borders, encreaſeth in her Numbers, juſt as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Intereſt did the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> by opening a Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary to all Malefactors. And why ſhould it not be ſo, if the Papal Power be of ſuch virtue and extent as is by that Jugler of <hi>Rome</hi> ſo violently challenged? He calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Ruler of <hi>Angels, Purgatory,</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> and ſaith, That his Tribunal and God's are all one; and hath proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly boaſted, that all that God can do, he can do, and what he doth is as God, not as Man: That he is the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
<pb facs="tcp:56278:10"/>
Head of the Church; the ſole Interpreter of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the Judge of Controverſies: That he is above Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils; that his Power is Abſolute, and his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees are Infallible: That he can change the nature of things, making what is Juſt, to be Unjuſt, and what is Vice, to be Virtue<hi>:</hi> That all Laws are within the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of his Breaſt; that he can diſpenſe with the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> that he is the Monarch of the World; and that he can diſpoſe of Kingdoms and Empires as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Now, if there be one word of Truth in all this, the Stiles they have given him at ſeveral times, is not ſuch an extraordinary piece of Courtſhip as we reckoned, but it would be a piece of Rudeneſs in Men not to treat him accordingly.</p>
            <p>The exerciſe of his Power and Dominion is in all points ſuitable to his Claim and Pretence; he antiquates the Precepts of our Great Redeemer, as things only of good Advice, and not Commanded; but makes it Mortal Sin for a Man only to doubt of any part of his Religion, and with all the Inſolence imaginable, under pain of eternal Damnation, demands the Obedience and Subjection of all Chriſtian Princes and People to his Papal Authority and Power; the denying of two things ſo reaſonable, as blind Obedience to his Power, and an Implicit Faith to his Doctrin, being the moſt unpardonable Crimes under his Diſpenſation. He hath, I confeſs been of late Years ſomewhat more retentive than formerly, as to his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent faculty of Diſpoſing Kingdoms, the thing not having ſucceeded ſo well with him in ſome Inſtances; but he lays the ſame Claim ſtill, and hath the ſame Inclination; and tho Velvet-headed, hath the more itch to be puſhing;
<pb facs="tcp:56278:10"/>
but however, in order to any occaſion he keeps himſelf in ure always, by Curſing ſome Prince or other upon every <hi>Maundy Thurſday;</hi> nor is there any, whether Prince or Nation, that oppoſe his Uſurpations, but are marked out under the notion of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> for Ruin and Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, whenſoever he ſhall give the Signal. That word <hi>Hereſie,</hi> miſapplied, hath ſerved the Romiſh Beaſt for many Ages to juſtifie, or rather give a colour for ſo many Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, Aſſaſſinations, Wars, Devaſtations and Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, by which his Faith hath been propagated, of which our Times have not wanted Examples; and more is to be expected for the future, if theſe Conſpirators can but at any time carry their Point; for by how much any thing is more falſe and unreaſonable, ſo much more Cruelty is requiſite to eſtabliſh it; and to introduce that which is abſurd, there muſt be ſomewhat done that is Barbarous and Inhuman. But nothing of any Sect in Religion can be more recommended by all theſe indearing Qualities, than <hi>Popery:</hi> The <hi>Pagans</hi> are excuſable by their natural Darkneſs without Revelation<hi>:</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> are tolerable, who ſee not beyond the <hi>Old-Teſtament: Mahomet</hi> was ſo honeſt, as to own what he would be at; That he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was the greateſt Prophet, and that his was a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Sword: So that theſe were all, as I may ſay, of another Allegiance; if they were Enemies, yet they were not Traytors: But the <hi>Romiſh Beaſt</hi> avowing <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> by Profeſſion, doth in Doctrin and Practice renounce it; and preſumeing to be the only <hi>Catholick,</hi> doth preſume to proſecute thoſe to death who dare Worſhip the Author of their Religion, inſtead of his pretended Vicegerent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56278:11"/>
And yet there is nothing more manifeſt, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his moſt notorious Forgeries, and falſifications of all Writers, than that the Prelate of <hi>Rome</hi> was for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hundreds of Years an honeſt Biſhop, as other Men are, and never ſo much as dreamed of the Seven Hills of that Univerſal Power, which he is now come to: Nay, he was the firſt that oppoſed that Pretenſion. But ſome of them at laſt growing Wiſer, by foiſting a Counterfeit Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and wreſting another Donation from our Saviour, advancing themſelves in a Weak, Ignorant and Credulous Age to that Temporal and Spiritual Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality that they are now ſeized of, <hi>Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this Rock will I build my Church:</hi> Of this I may ſay to your Majeſty; That never was a Biſhoprick and a Text of Scripture ſo Improved by good Management; thus by exerciſing in the quality of Chriſt's Vicar the Publick Function under an inviſible Prince, the <hi>Pope</hi> like the Maiors of the Palace, hath ſet his Maſter aſide, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the power over to a new Line of Papal Succeſſion. But who can, unleſs wilfully, be ignorant what wretched doings, what Bribery, what Ambitions there are; how long the Church is without a Head upon every Vacancy, till among the filthy Crew of bandying Cardinals, the Holy Ghoſt hath declared for a Pope of the French or Spaniſh Faction? Surely Sir, your Majeſty will judge it one of the greateſt Miracles of the Synagogue of <hi>Rome,</hi> that it ſhould ſtill continue, and that in all this time the Gates of Heaven ſhould not prevail againſt it.</p>
            <p>Give me leave, Great Sir, to obſerve to your Majeſty, that it is almoſt inconceivable how Princes can yet ſuffer a Power ſo pernicious, and Doctrins ſo deſtructive to all
<pb facs="tcp:56278:11"/>
Government, that ſo great a part of the Land ſhould be alienated and condemned to Pious Uſes, as they call it: That ſo many Thouſands of the People that are Clergy, ſhould by remaining unmarried, either fruſtrate Humane Nature, if they live chaſtly; or if otherwiſe, adulterate it, that they ſhould be privileged from all Labour and publick Service and exempt from the power of all Secular Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, that they being all bound by ſtrict Oaths and Vows of Obedience to the Pope, ſhould evacuate the Feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that is due to the Sovereign; nay, that not only the Clergy, but the Laity too, if of the Curſed Communion of that Synagogue, ſhould be obliged at any time to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel at the Pope's pleaſure: And yet how many of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Princes are content, or do chooſe to Reign up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe Conditions, which being ſo diſhonourable and dangerous, ſurely ſome great and weighty Reaſon does cauſe them to ſubmit to, whether it be out of perſonal Fear, having heard, perhaps, of ſeveral attempts which the blind Obedience of Popiſh Zealots hath executed againſt the Princes, or whether aiming at a more abſolute and tyrannical Government, they think it ſtill to be the Caſe of an Uſurping Emperor, and an Uſurping Biſhop; and that this, as other Cheats, is to be managed by Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy. But Sir, as far as I can apprehend, there is more of Sloth than of Policy on the Princes ſide in this whole matter, and all that pretence of enſlaving Men by the aſſiſtance of Religion, is neither more nor leſs than when the <hi>Bramine,</hi> by having the firſt Night of the Bride, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures himſelf of her Devotion, for the future, and makes her more fit for the Husband.</p>

This Reflection upon the ſtate of our Neighbours, in reſpect to Religion, doth ſufficiently illuſtrate our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs we enjoy by your Majeſties Acceſſion to the Crown, of ours: Therefore it ſpares me the labour of deſcribing it further, than by the rule of Contraries, our Religion and Intereſt, ſtanding upon all points in a direct Oppoſition to the above-mentioned Errors, our Doctrin being true to the Principles of the firſt Inſtitution of Chriſt, the Miniſtry being formed upon the Primitive Model, and no Eccleſiaſtical Power, juſtling with the Civil, but all concurring in the Common Obedience to the chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate: Nor therefore is there any, whether Prince, or Nation, that can at this time with leſs probability be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced back to the Romiſh Communion, than the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Intereſt here in <hi>England:</hi> For if we reſpect our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God, what appearance is there, that after ſo dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and general enlightning of our Minds, with the ſacred Truth of the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, we ſhould again put out our own Eyes to wander through the palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Darkneſs of that Groſs Superſtition? But for as much as many Men are leſs concern'd for their Intereſt in Heaven, than on Earth; this ſeeming the nearer and more certain, alſo on this account, our Alteration from the Proteſtant Religion, is the more inconſiſtent with temporal Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, when beſides the common ill Examples and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences obſervable Abroad, whereby we might grow wiſe at the Expence of our Neighbours, we cannot but reflect upon our own Experiments at Home, which would make even Fools docible. The whole Reign of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> the Firſt, in which the Papiſts made Fuel of the Proteſtants; the Excommunicating and Deprivation of
<pb facs="tcp:56278:12"/>
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> by the Pope, purſued by ſo many Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Attempts upon her Perſon, by her own Subjects, and the Invaſion of <hi>Eighty-Eight</hi> by the <hi>Spaniard:</hi> The two Breves of the Pope, in order to exclude King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt from the Succeſſion to the Crown, ſeconded by the <hi>Gunpowder-Treaſon:</hi> In the time of K. <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, beſides what they contributed to the Civil Wars in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Rebellion and Horrid Maſſacre in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which ended in the Ruin and Deſtruction of the Perſon and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of that King: In the time of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second we ſaw ſeveral viſible Effects of the ſame Spirit, as the Firing of <hi>London,</hi> the Popiſh Deſign carried on againſt the Perſon and Government of that King, not that he was a Proteſtant; but becauſe he came not up to the Meaſures of the Jeſuits and his Brother the late King <hi>James:</hi> But as for him, his whole Life was nothing elſe but a Contrivance or a Plot againſt our Religion, Laws, and Liberties: But this Horrid Conſpiracy againſt your Majeſty's Perſon and Government, being ſo happily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, we cannot but hope that the Diſcovery of ſuch a tremendous Villany, will ſo rivet the Proteſtant Intereſt and Religion, that it ſhall ſtand ſo ſure, that the Gates of <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall not prevail againſt it. 'Tis true Sir, before the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot, in the time of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, many looſe People, ſome alſo of Note, were perverted to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but when that Villany was detected, then a Check was put for a time to the Popiſh Parties making ſuch a number of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, till the Prieſts ſaw that King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second did not Proſecute the Diſcovery of that Conſpiracy, he being in every part and particular thereof, but that of his own
<pb facs="tcp:56278:13"/>
Life; then they let looſe their Seducers, who were not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incouraged, but alſo recompenſed for ſuch a piece of Treachery. But when the late King invaded the Crown, then large ſteps were taken to ruin the People, and to Pox them in their Religion.</p>
            <p>Upon your Majeſties Landing in the Year 1688, the Keeper of the Priſon of the <hi>King's-Bench</hi> gave me ſome liberty, and I went amongſt ſome of the moſt ſubſtantial of my Friends, who did inform me under what a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation our Great Conſpirators were, and how ready they were to have given up all their Ill-gotten Eſtates, by which they had been enabled to proſecute the wicked Deſigns of the late King, to ſubvert our moſt Excellent Religion; and none of us did queſtion but that they would have been called to an account for all thoſe tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Devices of theirs; of this, I am ſure, they would have given up their All to have ſaved their Lives: But your Majeſty being reſolved not to begin your Reign with Blood, was inclined not to make any ſevere Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of theſe Men; which a thinking Man might judge would lay ſuch an Obligation upon them all of Gratitude and Obedience to your Majeſty and Government, nay, theſe above-named freſh Inſtances of the Papal Tyranny in Religion, might have been enough to have cautioned the Kingdom from giving them little hopes of being able of being brought to reſtore King <hi>James,</hi> who was ſo bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotted to the Arbitrary Proceedings of the Romiſh Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue; our Noble-men ſome of them had a great part of Church Lands in their hands, our Clergy-men great Preferments, all which muſt have gone notwithſtanding their Zeal for the Divine Right of Succeſſion and Paſſive

Obedience and Non-reſiſtence: Therefore the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Temporal Intereſt one would have thought might have gone a great way to have engaged them to be true to their own Cauſe and Quarrel. In a word, a Man that obſerved the Inſolencies of the Popiſh Party againſt thoſe Prelates that were committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> would have made them for ever to have declared an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting War againſt that Party of Red-letter'd Men, and heartily have come into your Majeſties Intereſt, in order to have ſecured our Liberties, Properties, and Religion: But to conclude this Head, the Excellency of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, of which ſome of the Conſpirators had made a Profeſſion, ſince they were <hi>Engliſh</hi> that had Bodies, Souls and Eſtates to ſave, and found your Majeſty reſolved (if they had pleaſed) to ſave all, they upon the ſcore of your Royal Grace and Mercy to them ſhewed at the beginning of your Reign, and continued Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, would have invited to have joined in with your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to have preſerved that Religion they profeſs, and not in ſtead of that to have attempted the Murther of your Perſon, and the Invaſion of your Realm with a Foreign Power, in order to reſtore an Abdicated King, who hates their Religion, and will violate their Liberties.</p>
            <p>I come Sir, now to obſerve to your Majeſty, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of this Civil Government, which theſe Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators would change into Slavery. The Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Rule not upon the ſame Terms with thoſe of our Neighbour Nations, who having by Force or by Fraud Uſurped that due ſhare which their Subjects had in the Government, are now for ſome Ages paſt in Poſſeſſion of an Arbitrary Power, (which yet no Preſciption can make
<pb facs="tcp:56278:14"/>
legal) and Excerciſe it over their Perſons and Eſtates in a moſt Tyrannical Manner, but here in <hi>England</hi> the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects do retain their Proportion in the Legiſlature, and the very meaneſt Commoner of <hi>England</hi> is repreſented in Parliament, and is a Party to thoſe Laws by which the Prince is ſworn to Govern himſelf and his Subjects: No Mony is to be levied, but by common Conſent, no Man is for Life, Limb, or Goods, or Liberty, at the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Supream Magiſtrate, but we have the ſame Right (modeſtly underſtood) to our Property, that the Prince hath to his Regality.</p>
            <p>In all Caſes where the King is concerned we have our juſt Remedy as againſt any private Perſon in the Neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> or in the High-Court of Parliament; his very Prerogative is no more than what the Law hath determined: His Great Seal, which is the Stamp of his Legitimate Pleaſure, yet is no longer current than upon the tryal it is found legal; he cannot commit any Perſon by his particular Warrant, he cannot himſelf be Witneſs in any Cauſe, the ballance of Publick Juſtice being ſo delicate, that not the Head only, but even the Breath of the Prince would turn the Scale; nothing is to be left to the King's Will, but all is ſubjected to his Authority, by which it follows, that he can do no wrong, nor receive wrong; and a King of <hi>England</hi> keeping theſe meaſures, may without Arrogance be ſaid to remain the only Intelligent Ruler over a Rational People; in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence therefore, and acknowledgment of ſo good a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment under his Influence, his Perſon is moſt Sacred and Inviolable, and whatever Exceſſes are committed againſt ſo high a Truſt, nothing of them is imputed to
<pb facs="tcp:56278:14"/>
him, as being free from the neceſſity or temptation, but his Miniſters only are accountable for all, and muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it at their Perils: He hath a vaſt Revenue, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ariſing from the Sweat of the Labourers and the Rent of the Farmer, and the Induſtry of the Merchant; and conſequently out of the Eſtate of the Gentleman a large competence to defray the ordinary Charge of the Crown, and maintain its Grandure and Luſtre; and if any extraordinary occaſion happen, or be but with any probable deſcency pretended, the whole Land at what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſeaſon of the Year, doth yield them a plentiful Harveſt. So forward are the People to give, that a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner would think that they could neither will nor chuſe, but that the asking of a Supply was a meer piece of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, the People of <hi>England</hi> being ſo ready to give it. The King of <hi>England</hi> is the Fountain of Honour, and hath the diſtribution of ſo many profitable Offices, of the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold, of the Revenue, of State, of Law, of Religion, of the Navy; and when it is neceſſary that the King hath an Army, he diſpoſeth of a multitude of Military Offices, that it ſeems as if this Nation had ſcarce Men of Abilities to ſupply all theſe Employments. So that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> are nothing inferior to other Princes, ſaving in being abridged in injuring their own Subjects, but have as large a Field as any of external Felicity, wherein to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their own Virtue, and to reward and encourage it in others. In a word, your Majeſty hath enlarged our Liberties, in conſenting to the Bill to <hi>Regulate Tryals in Caſes of High-Treaſon;</hi> in which there are large Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties granted to any that fall under that black Circumſtance, that their Lives may not be at the mercy of a Mercenary
<pb facs="tcp:56278:15"/>
Judge, or Judges, if God ſhould in his Judgment leave poor <hi>England</hi> to ſuch Men: But your Majeſty hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and I queſtion not but your Royal inclination will carry you on to compleat our ſecurity from ſuch Vermin. Therefore to conclude, what a Government is this we enjoy, than which nothing can come nearer the Divine Perfection! The Monarch enjoys a capacity of doing all the good imaginable to Mankind, but under a diſability of doing any thing that is Evil.</p>
            <p>This Scheme of the Civil Government the Late King did well know, and therefore in Council on the day of his Acceſſion to the Crown, he was pleaſed to ſay, That the Laws of <hi>England</hi> were ſufficient to make the King of <hi>England</hi> as great a Monarch as he could wiſh or deſire; ſo that your Majeſty may ſee that he could own that the Greatneſs of the Engliſh Monarchy had its Birth and riſe from the Laws. Who then would have leſſened him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as he did, by breaking in upon thoſe very Laws that had made him Great? And who would have broken ſo excellent a Government as made him Secure and Happy? And what Subject of <hi>England,</hi> Papiſt or Proteſtant, that would loſe ſuch Immunities and Privileges, by joyning in with that unhappy Man to deſtroy themſelves: Were they ſo in love with King <hi>James,</hi> that they were not ſatisfied till they had him? Nay, he and they waded through King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Blood that he might Reign: Why then did they not keep the terms of the Government, which would have been the moſt effectual way of continuing him on the Throne. Beſides all this, we cannot forget that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments under Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, and King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, made it Treaſon
<pb facs="tcp:56278:15"/>
in whoſoever that ſhould attempt to Seduce any one of the meaneſt of your Majeſty's Subjects to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And the Long Parliament held in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, to all Penalties of the Statute Law added an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity for any Man to ſay, that that King was a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> or an introducer of <hi>Popery.</hi> What Lawleſs and incapable Miſcreants were theſe<hi>!</hi> What wicked Traytors were thoſe Men who did indeavour to pervert the whole Body of Proteſtants, and to bring that about in effect, which even to mention, was penal; at one <hi>Italian ſtroke,</hi> attempting to ſubvert the Government and Religion, to kill the Body and damn the Soul of the Nation.</p>
            <p>Your Majeſty finds to this day, there are ſuch a Set of Men in this Nation, who have undertaken and have made it their buſineſs under your Majeſties happy, legal and perfect Government by the intended deſtruction of your Royal Perſon to introduce a French Slavery, and inſtead of ſo pure a Religion that your Majeſty ventured hard to preſerve, to eſtabliſh the <hi>Roman Idolatry;</hi> either of which Crimes are of the higheſt nature; for if we look upon the Government, if the Murther of your Royal Perſon be a fact ſo horrid as no Man can find words e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to declare his deteſtation and abhorrence of it; how much more then is the Murther of your Royal Perſon, with an intent to Aſſaſſinate the Kingdom? And Sir, none will deny, but that to alter the Monarchy of theſe Kingdoms into a Republick, is High Treaſon. So by the ſame fundamental Rule, the Crime is no leſs to Murther your Royal Perſon, in order to make the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy Abſolute.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56278:16"/>
Sir, I beg your Majeſty's leave to tell you, that my Heart is much enlarged to your Majeſty; I beſeech your Majeſty that your Royal Heart may be for this one time enlarged to me in your Grace and Pardon, for this trouble I now give your moſt excellent Majeſty: Let me undertake upon ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inquiry to give your Majeſty ſome ſatisfaction who theſe Men are that have from the Year 1660, to this day, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to Subvert our Government and our Religion. Had theſe Men been the old honeſt Cavaleers that fought for <hi>Charles</hi> the I. or ſuffered much in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> II. it would have been allowable in them, as oft as their Wound did break out at Spring or Fall, to think of a more Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Government, as a ſovereign Balſom for their Aches, or to imagin that no Weapon-Salve but that of the Moſs that Grows on an Enemies Skull, could cure them; or could they (to have kept their Hands in ure) have fought their Cauſe over again, ſince they ſaw they were neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and left to Starve, yet their Age and times they lived in, and their unjuſt uſage they met with from two Kings, might have pleaded ſomething on their behalf in mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Damages. But Sir, give me leave to make this Remark to your Majeſty concerning thoſe Gentlemen, that they were and are ſtill (if any of them remain) too Generous, too good Chriſtians and Subjects, too affectionate to the Engliſh legal Government, to be capable of ſuch an Impreſſion; whereas theſe Conſpirators that carried on the deſign of ſubverting our Religion into <hi>Popery</hi> and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Government into downright Slavery, are ſuch as have not one drop of Cavaleer Blood, or no Bowels at leaſt of a Cavaleer in them, but ſuch as ſtarved the Cavaleers, to revel and ſurfeit upon their Calamities,
<pb facs="tcp:56278:16"/>
making their Perſons and the very Cauſe by pretending to it themſelves, almoſt Ridiculous.</p>
            <p>Or had theſe Villains been all of the Popiſh commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and avowed ſo to be, give me leave to ſay it over again to your Majeſty, your danger would have been the leſs; their Religion would in ſome meaſure have been anſwerable for the Errors and Extravgancies they might have been guilty of to promote it; but theſe render their intended Villany more black, they were Proteſtants, and of the <hi>Church of England</hi> too, that joyned with Papiſts to Aſſaſſinate your Royal Perſon: What can any Man ſay for them? Your Majeſty knows what to do with them: Theſe Villains, becauſe I perceive they lye under a great difficulty to find Accomplices enough at home to Mutiny and Rebel and Murther your Majeſties true and loyal Subjects, therefore they put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the Banner and Pay of the French King, to compleat their wicked deſigns and purpoſes, to bring a foreign Enemy to Invade us; that King being endowed with all thoſe which in a French Prince, or in an Abdica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted King, may paſs for Vertues; but in any private Man they would be Capital; and moreover, ſo abounding in Zeal for <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery</hi> above all other Princes, that none elſe could engage both Body and Soul in ſuch a Villanous Undertaking; to which Conſideration, adding that their Intereſts are both one, and the one is, and the other would be the Maſter of abſolute Dominion, and both are inveterate Enemies to your Majeſty and this Proteſtant Kingdom; and the French King is in all reſpects the moſt likely to ſupport, maintain and uphold them in thoſe Attempts, they being ſo exactly ſuitable to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
<pb facs="tcp:56278:17"/>
of his Soul, yea, and of the Late King's Soul too, notwithſtanding your Majeſty's being his Nephew and Son-in-Law into the bargain.</p>
            <p>Sir, theſe Conſpirators have made it their buſineſs to aſperſe your Majeſty's Government, becauſe of the great Taxes that are upon the Nation; but I never find them to take notice of the Treaſure that K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. waſted. It's true, he was engaged in two moſt impious Wars againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and theſe Wars were very chargable to the Nation<hi>:</hi> But beſides thoſe two Wars, he ſpent abundance upon his Whores, Pimps, and Bauds, under the notion of ſecret Service, and yet we find nothing to be ſaid of that: Our Taxes are greater than ever the Nation paid; but your Majeſty's Loyal Subjects do not believe them ſo heavy, but that they can and will hold it out many Years. In a word, there are none that retain their Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and Duty to your Majeſty, but are highly pleaſed with your Majeſty's being fully ſupplied to carry on ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a War; and there is no good Man but will rather hazard his Perſon to keep the Enemy abroad, than ſee either a <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army within your Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> deſtroying our Subſtance, burning our Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and committing thoſe Barbarities that were done in the <hi>Palatinate</hi> by the one, or in <hi>Ireland</hi> in 41 by the other; ſo that your Majeſty may ſee, that we that are Engliſh Men are not ſo much concerned at our Taxes, as at the imminent Dangers your Majeſty is daily expoſed to, both at home and abroad. And (being more confident than perhaps becomes me, to judge the thoughts of Men;) I believe the Conſpirators are more concerned that your Majeſty is yet in the Land of the Living, than
<pb facs="tcp:56278:17"/>
at any of theſe Taxes, of which I ſuppoſe their proportion is but ſmall.</p>
            <p>But your Majeſty is not the firſt and only Prince that Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Conſpirators have traduced, as theſe have filled the Ears of the French King and the Late King, with monſtrous Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of your Majeſty's Oppreſſing the Nation with unheard of Taxes, thereby inſinuating to him and his chargeable Gueſs, how eaſy it would be to reduce the Nation, that they might have farther opportunity of revelling and ſurfeiting upon his Treaſure. So the Fugitive Conſpirators in the time of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> were perpetually whiſpering in the Ears of the then King of <hi>Spain,</hi> with prodigious Stories as falſe as <hi>Hell,</hi> thereby to Exaſperate that then great and Powerful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch againſt the Kingdom, and did diſparage the Forces of the ſaid Queen, and the poſture and conduct of her Affairs; in order to make him believe, that the Conqueſt of <hi>England</hi> to be a matter of no great difficulty: They did calumniate that Queen's Juſtice, and blamed her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings againſt Seminaries and Romiſh Prieſts, and for having a jealous eye upon thoſe of their Communion, for receiving thoſe Prieſts and Jeſuits thus ſent into this Realm to ſeduce her Subjects, and to withdraw them from their Obedience; but our Conſpirators could not traduce your Majeſty, or blacken your Government with thoſe Points; none might have been more eaſie and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et under your happy Government than they, if their Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainous Principles would have ſuffer'd them; and not only ſo, but they might have had Preferments too, whilſt poor Sufferers, and your hearty Friends were Starving, had not their damnable Inſolencies and implacable hatred of
<pb facs="tcp:56278:18"/>
your Majeſty's Perſon and the welfare of the Kingdom been an obſtacle in their way; but that which I ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to your Majeſty, that they traduced that Queen with overcharging her Subjects with heavy and unaccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed Taxes: But it was then well known, that no Prince could maintain ſuch a Fleet at Sea, and ſuch an Army at Land without great Expence and Charge; for her main end was to prevent a Foreign Invaſion, by which that wiſe Queen certainly knew would be more Expenſive and Chargeable to the Nation, than a Maintenance of a Force at Sea and Land would be to prevent it.</p>
            <p>It is not unknown, that your Majeſties Prudence and Conduct hath appeared, that tho your Majeſty found the Nation in a Lamentable Condition, the Trade Sunk, Liberties Seized, the People in a Ferment, the Enſigns of the many Murders committed in the Reign of the Late King, upon the Gates of the City, and upon your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's acceſſion to the Throne, a neceſſary War to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, yet the Trade hath in ſome meaſure been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, Liberties reſtored, the condition of the Nation much mended, and like to be more and more impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, both as to its Honour and Intereſt, the People Quieted, and Reprizals about to be made for the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of our Friends. Your Majeſty hath Reigned now Seven Years, and never raiſed one Penny without the conſent of Parliament, and by the Authority of the ſame; and the Late King had not Reigned ſeven Hours, but he Levied Mony without Parliament: But I would fain have theſe Fugitive Cut-throats that envy and malign your Majeſty's eaſie Government, to compare the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb facs="tcp:56278:18"/>
of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> with the urgent occaſion your Majeſty hath of greater Taxes than ever that Princeſ could pretend to; for it is moſt plain beyond all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, <hi>Firſt,</hi> that Wars are now more chargeable in this Age than in that which ſhe Reigned. Then it is plain, your Majeſty hath had but little or no Aſſiſtance (the <hi>Dutch</hi> excepted) from any Proteſtant Prince, or any other Prince of the Confederacy; but you have been rather neceſſitated to help them; in the laſt place, your Majeſty hath every year of your Reign, been obliged to have great Forces both at Sea and Land; the Charges of your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Predeceſſors have been for the moſt part Volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; their Soldiers fought upon theſe Terms, no Purchaſe, no Pay; and therefore the Subjects were not ſo much bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened by Foreign Wars, but they went forth to Conquer. Now its plain, that for a King to defend his own Realm and the Liberties thereof, is more Expenſive than to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer other Princes Countries, for the Conqueror would always pay himſelf and Army in his new Conqueſt: But Sir, that which is a wonder to me is this, that they ſhould complain to King <hi>Lewis</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> of the greatneſs of the Taxes here; ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hey think that although he ſhould comply with them once more to Invade us, yet at the ſame time to charge your Majeſty with that thing as a high Crime, muſt be an unmannerly Charge, ſince the French King himſelf doth the ſame every Year, by his own Arbitrary Deſpotick Power, that your Majeſty hath only done by the Advice and Conſent and Authority of a dutiful and loyal Parliament.
<pb facs="tcp:56278:19"/>
But truly Sir, I muſt here acquaint your Majeſty, that ſome People have condemned the French King and King <hi>James</hi> too, for giving Credit to theſe Conſpirators; for firſt they ought to have conſidered, That none of the vain Pamphlets that either <hi>Ferguſon</hi> or <hi>L'Eſtrange,</hi> or any of that raſcally Crew ever writ, were ever able to ſhake the natural and dutiful Affections of our Engliſh Nation to your Majeſty; and of this I am ſure they have had ſufficient Experience. In the next place, many of theſe Conſpirators are Prieſts and Jeſuits, more fit to manage a Pen than a Launce, to diſpute of Philoſophy, than to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe of War; to have a low opinion of their own Parts, than to be prodigal in their Aſſurance; and let them ſay no more than what is true, and judge that to be the great truth that is beſt made out. In the laſt Place, if that thoſe have not been of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> yet then they have been Fellows of deſperate Fortunes, which they are ambitious to advance by Lies and the ruin of their Country.</p>
            <p>I do not wonder why they traduce and aſperſe your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Government, for they are and have been for many Years plotting your Ruin and Deſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>tion, both before and ſince you were our King; and the buſineſs is plain, that they can never hurt your Perſon, till they have deſtroyed your Intereſt, and have withdrawn a conſiderable Party from your Majeſty, by which they may make a Stand; then they may poſſibly (if not diſcovered) make an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon your Perſon, which they cannot do till your Intereſt is deſtroyed by their many traiterous Aſperſions (and they believed) thrown upon your Majeſty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56278:19"/>
Nay, tho King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second did comply with them in many things; yet becauſe he did not comply in every thing, they ſpared not him, but made it their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to traduce him; it is true, his Government was Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable, becauſe he complied not with the Terms and preſerved not the fundamental Conſtitutions of an Engliſh Monarchy; therefore his Government was expoſed to the Cenſure of ſome that oppoſed even his proceedings, when they had liberty, as they were Members of Parliament, for they had juſt Ground to believe that he cloſed with the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, againſt that of his own Kingdom, and with the <hi>Popiſh Party,</hi> in order to betray the Proteſtant Intereſt both at Home and Abroad; and the Conſpirators they let loſe their Tongues againſt him, becauſe he was not wholly theirs, but ever and anon gave them the ſlip, by which they were diſappointed in their Deſigns; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in a Letter of theirs to their Party in <hi>Scotland,</hi> they plainly ſay, That he was ſo addicted to his Pleaſure, that he was not fit to Govern; and in another Letter they charge him with unſteadineſs in his Reſolutions as to Religion; and when they had a deſign to haſten his Exit, then they charge him with all the Falſeneſs and Vileneſs that might be imagined to be in the worſt of Men; ſo that your Majeſty is not the only Prince that theſe Miſcreants have Traduced: And truly it filled me with great Horror when I ſaw their Induſtry in diſperſing their filthy and ſcandalous Libels againſt your Majeſty and Government, it being the method of thoſe Men firſt to beget a diſaffection in your Subjects againſt your Majeſty (if it were poſſible) that your Deſtruction might be the more eaſily accompliſh'd
<pb facs="tcp:56278:20"/>
by them, but your Majeſty hath been very happy; for nothing theſe Villains could either Write or Speak, ever made the leaſt impreſſion upon the Hearts of your Loving Subjects; but on the other hand it filled them with Zeal againſt that party of Men, eſpecially ſince they were ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible of that Grace and Clemency by which their Lives had been continued to them, for we all know that this was not the firſt Conſpiracy that they have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in againſt your Majeſty; I pray God it may be the laſt.</p>
            <p>Give me leave to put your Majeſty in mind of a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in one of Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Letters to the French King's Confeſſor which is this; he ſaith there. <hi>The Deſign proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo well that he doubted not, but the Buſineſs would be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged to the utter ruin of the Proteſtant Party.</hi> So the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of theſe Cut-throats proſpered ſo well, that they did not doubt but that in a little time their Buſineſs would be managed to the Deſtruction of your Majeſty and your Proteſtant Subjects; for they carried on one Deſign to Murder your Perſon, and another to Invade your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms with a Foreign Force; and they were much in the right, for it would have been impoſſible for them to have Reſtored the Late King by an Invaſion, and to have ſet up <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery,</hi> without deſtroying a Proteſtant King and the Proteſtant Intereſt in <hi>England.</hi> All good Proteſtants I hope will find to their great Satisfaction, that theſe Traitors have brought Deſtruction upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Party; and that not a Man of them ſhall Eſcape; for your Majeſty's Proceedings with ſuch, will be as quick as their Gunpowder, and much more
<pb facs="tcp:56278:20"/>
effectual: So that your humble Subjects may rejoice in your Majeſties Juſtice upon theſe Men, ſince Grace and Clemency could not Reform them.</p>
            <p>Sir, I was a Diſcoverer of a Conſpiracy carried on by the Popiſh Party, for the Deſtruction of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and your Majeſty when Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and for the Subverſion of the Government, and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion in <hi>England,</hi> and all over <hi>Europe;</hi> but it was my Misfortune to diſcover a Conſpiracy to a King, that was engaged in every part thereof, but that of his own Life; and I met with ſuch Oppoſition from the then Duke of <hi>York</hi> and his Conſpirators, that it was ſcarce poſſible for me to have withſtood it had not I had a more than an ordinary Preſence of Mind to have ſupported me: This, Sir, I ſay, was my Caſe, yet notwithſtanding all the Oppoſition I met with all, I gave the Popiſh Party ſuch a deadly Wound, that they could not be cured of it, no not in the Reign of the late King, though they had all the Incouragement that Men could have, becauſe the Villany of that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Men ſtuck ſo upon the Minds of the People of <hi>England,</hi> that no Stone was left unturn'd to rid our Hands of them, and their Popiſh King, which was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually done, when your Majeſty undertook and compleated the Deliverance of this poor bleeding Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Many Men have wondered that the late King when he was Duke of <hi>York,</hi> ſhould have ſuch an Aſcenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy over his Brother King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second; ſince it is well known that when King <hi>Charles</hi> was upon
<pb facs="tcp:56278:21"/>
his return Home to enjoy his Crown, that the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> with the Queen Mother, was in a Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to have deſtroy'd King <hi>Charles,</hi> to the end, that he, the ſaid Duke of <hi>York,</hi> might have return'd Home and enjoy'd the Crown himſelf; the Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd the ſame, and ſo the deſign was baffled, yet no Man was ſo much in favour as the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and as a Teſtimony of the King's Grace and Favour; He was made Lord High Admiral of <hi>England,</hi> and held that Office till he openly refuſed the ſubſcribing the <hi>Teſt,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to an Act made in the Year 1673: But he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying that great and mighty Office of Lord High Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of <hi>England</hi> for ſeveral Years; He obtain'd the King's Favour; the Court was at his Will and Commandment, either for love to him, or for fear of his Greatneſs and Authority: He ſo demeaned himſelf to the King his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that that King would never believe that the great Intereſt that he had acquired by the Greatneſs of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice ſhould ever be abuſed to the prejudice of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; but for the King's Service and Benefit he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the number of his Friends and Followers, by gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying ſome with Naval Preferments, and others with Mony, always imploying his Purſe, his Credit, and his Countenance for the ſtrengthning his Party; and that in ſuch a manner as that the King could not but perceive it, yet he ſo diſſembled the Matter, and pretended to ſuch a degree of Obedience and Affection to the King, and gratify'd him in his ſinful Pleaſures, that the King did not diſtruſt his Proceedings, and that he might continue in the King's Favour, he made it his buſineſs as much as in
<pb facs="tcp:56278:21"/>
him lay to comply with his Humours and Humane Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: And when he was forced to lay down that great Office, by reaſon of his refuſal of the Sacramental Teſt above-mentioned, he obtain'd of the King, that his Friends and high Church Conſpirators might be put in Commiſſioners of the Admiralty in his place, he made all the Miniſters of ſtate ſure to him, ſo that when he was baniſhed into <hi>Flanders,</hi> a firſt and a ſecond time, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his return he procured that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> ſhould be baniſhed the Court, he judging him to be his Enemy, and then his Conſpirators endeavour'd not in vain to keep the ſaid Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> in diſcredit with the King: But the then Parliament being ſenſible of the dangerous Conſpiracy againſt the Proteſtant Religion, and the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom, and the King's Perſon, carried on by the Popiſh Party, and finding that the Duke's being a Papiſt had incouraged them in that Helliſh Plot, they having great hopes of his coming ſuch to the Crown, they fell upon the Duke, and to prevent the Storm from falling upon the Duke, the King ſends him into <hi>Scotland,</hi> after that he had bridled and ſadled that Kingdom in ſome meaſure to his Hearts content: He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies himſelf to his Friends to procure his return, he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly permitted to return, to the great Joy of his Party: He fawns upon the King's Whore that he kept in the <hi>Matted Gallery</hi> at <hi>White hall,</hi> and who he created Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> who had a great Intereſt in the King, and obtain'd at firſt or laſt whatſoever pleaſed her of the King, that whoſoever he was (were he never ſo high in the King's Favour) that diſpleaſed her in time
<pb facs="tcp:56278:22"/>
loſt the King's good Will and good Opinion; this Duke carried himſelf ſo towards her, that he ſeemed to affect nothing more than her good liking, and yet not ſo deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous thereof as that he would wholly depend thereupon, knowing that the King although he always attributed much to this infamous Whore, and was pleaſed that ſhe was Reverenced and Reſpected, yet he could not well bear that her good Will ſhould be ſought above his own Royal Favour: But the Duke did continue his Friendſhip with her, hoping in time to command them both; and when ever he found any of the King's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters not throughly complying with him, and not ready to follow his Deſigns, he laboured by all means to have them removed and others put in their Places, who would not fail him in his wicked Deſigns and Purpoſes, nor to depend wholly upon his Favour, and alſo to make him privy (if need were) to whatſoever Buſineſs and Affair of State they were commanded by the King to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch; whereby he came (tho he were out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel upon the ſame account as he had left the Office of <hi>Lord High Admiral)</hi> to the perfect knowledge of all that was purpoſed and determined by the King's Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; and he was in ſuch Favour and Credit, that even the principal Officers about the King, either for Faer or Love, or by other Mens Examples, ſubmitted themſelves wholly unto his Devotion; and he had ſuch Intereſt in the King's Court and Courtiers, that all, or moſt part of them, ſeemed to be at his ſole Diſpoſition, and to affect him more than the King himſelf. He having Inſtalled himſelf in this manner in the Court, and in a great
<pb facs="tcp:56278:22"/>
meaſure withdrew the Hearts of the principal Officers thereof from their Duty and Love to their King: He thought it alſo not enough to be inveſted in their Favours, but all the endeavours were uſed that he might have the Affections of the Common People; to procure this, he obtains the help of a filthy Strumpet called <hi>High-Church,</hi> whoſe Blaſphemous Preachers of <hi>Paſſive-Obedience</hi> and <hi>Non-Reſiſtance,</hi> did him mighty Service in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: And what Feaſting there was provided for the Apprentices of the City of <hi>London,</hi> who were a ſort of young Men who were to be by his Conſpirators debauched in order to his Service; and by the great promiſes of his Grace and Favour he eaſily and quickly perſwaded the Conſpirators to favour his Cauſe and Conſpiracy: Nay, all the legal Force throughout the Kingdom, from the Lord Lieutenant of a County, to a Deputy Lieutenant, and Captains, Lieutenants, and Enſigns and Serjeants, were all and every of them his Creatures; the Juſtices of Peace and Sheriffs were his Admirers, and the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe</hi> and <hi>Exciſe</hi> were all at his Devoire, from one end of the the Kingdom to the other; and generally Vintners and Ale-drapers were of his Intereſt; and ſo was old <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> the Guide, and his little Scoundrel Clergy of the Church; by which means many of the Common People were ſo ready, willing, and deſirous to perform and accompliſh his Pleaſure, as that in reſpect of their Obedience to him, he ſeemed, to lack nothing but the name of a King, to be one. Notwithſtanding the great Honour and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the Court ſhewed him in the Reign of his Brother, and the Love and Affection the Commonalty did bear
<pb facs="tcp:56278:23"/>
him; the nearneſs of his relation to the King, and the mighty Intereſt he had, and the unaccuſtomed Authority he had in ſo ſlie a manner Uſurped, the high Attempts and Imaginations he had lodged in his Heart, and the great Opinion he had of himſelf, yet he was ſo far from appearing puffed up with Pride and Diſdain to thoſe that were much below him, that he thought not ſcorn to give Audience to the meaneſt Man that had buſineſs with him.</p>
            <p>Now, how could a Man of my Circumſtances, having provoked him by the Diſcovery of the Helliſh Conſpiracy, carried on by him and his wicked Popiſh Party, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhly affected, ſtand againſt ſuch a Man of ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; for he and his Party when they could not hurt me by their Subborned Witneſſes againſt me, not only to deſtroy my Reputation, but my Life? Then they procured King <hi>Charles</hi> to take away my Maintenance and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and this angry Duke he Sued me for charging him to be reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and then Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borned Witneſſes againſt me, and procured me in his Brother's Reign to be Indicted of two pretended Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; but he being impatient in his Expectation, he ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Crown from his Brother's Head, and mounted the Throne, and then he and his Popiſh Witneſſes, his Packt Juries, and Impudent, Lawleſs, Senſeleſs and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinary Judges compleated my Ruin; and I muſt have been deſtroyed, had not God by your Majeſty's coming to <hi>England</hi> reſcued me beyond all Expectation.</p>
            <p>Give me leave Sir, with the humbleſt Submiſſion to your Majeſty, to obſerve, that where there is a Subject of
<pb facs="tcp:56278:23"/>
ſuch Credit with the King, of ſuch Authority with the Court, and ſuch Power in every County of the Kingdom, as the Duke of <hi>York</hi> had when he was a Subject, and to have ſuch an Intereſt in the Church and Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Military Employments, and Naval Preferments: Could it be poſſibly hard or difficult for him to inſult over and ſuppreſs thoſe Truths I then Revealed, for the ſervice and preſervation of the Religion, Laws and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of my Native Country, againſt him and his nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Party. And how much more was it eaſie for him to deſtroy me when he had the Crown it ſelf upon his own Head? But above all, Great Sir, how can it be, that ſuch a Subject, perverted to ſuch a Villainous Religion, ſhould not be moſt dangerous to his Prince and Country? And to what a lamentable State and Condition he brought it when he had Poſſeſſion? your Majeſty well knows.</p>
            <p>It was therefore high time for the Proteſtants of this Kingdom to implore your Majeſties Aid and Help in that Hour of Diſtreſs, that the Nation was brought to, by that unhappy Perſon, and his wicked Accomplices; and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God, for putting it into your Royal Heart to come over to us, and to bring along with you a Force ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to defend your Perſon from him, and his Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and tho he and they would have inſinuated, that your Majeſty came to Conquer us, and Enſlave us; and notwithſtanding the villainous Scribling of ſome that would to this day aſſert your Majeſty's Title to be by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. We that are Proteſtants, do from the bottom of our Hearts believe, That your Majeſty had no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb facs="tcp:56278:24"/>
in your Royal Undertaking, but to procure a ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Religion, Liberty and Property of the People of this Nation, on ſo ſure a Foundation that there might be no danger of this Nation's Relapſing into the like Miſeries at any time hereafter: And for the Juſtice of your Cauſe, your Majeſty may appeal to God, and to all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Kings, Princes, States and People, in bringing a Force ſufficient to ſuppreſs the Conſpirators and their damnable helliſh Conſpiracy: And with the like Juſtice your Majeſty then might require and adjure all <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Proteſtants to aſſiſt you againſt thoſe Enemies of God, his Chriſt, his Goſpel, and the Rights of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Liberties of Mankind. And your Majeſty might with the like Juſtice have Puniſhed thoſe as <hi>Banditi</hi> and Free-booters, and common Rogues and Traytors to their Country, that ſhould have appeared to Oppoſe your Majeſty in ſo Glorious a Work you had undertaken for the Reſcuing three Kingdoms out of the Jaws of <hi>Hell, Rome,</hi> and <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since God engaged me in aſſerting the Laws and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>England,</hi> and the Proteſtant Religion, and in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the Malicious and Helliſh Deſigns of the <hi>Popiſh Party</hi> againſt us, the Oppoſition of that Party and the Paſſive-Obedience and Non-Reſiſtance Clergy-men grew ſtrong and thick upon me, and how thoſe Varlets run in with the <hi>Popiſh Party,</hi> together with their Guide, Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger L'Eſtrange,</hi> to decry the diſcovery of the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> and would to this day decry by the very ſame Method they then uſed, the preſent Diſcovery of this Helliſh Deſign againſt your Majeſty's Royal Perſon, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb facs="tcp:56278:24"/>
and Government of this Nation, if they had but hopes to go off with Impunity, and by your Majeſty's leave I dear challenge any of theſe Men to tell me what particular there was by me diſcovered, that did not in proceſs of time come to paſs: It will be to tedious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite all particulars of the diſcovery of the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> that did come to paſs, and from the diſmal and ſad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of that Conſpiracy your Majeſty under God hath delivered us, or elſe theſe Villainous Traytors would inſult, and ask why and to what end your Majeſty expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed your Royal Perſon in your late Glorious Undertaking, in the Year 1688?</p>
            <p>The evil uſage I have had from our Popiſh high Church, Non-juring Conſpirators, hath ſo hardened and inured me to ſuffering, that I praiſe God, who hath taught me ſome weak Rudiments of his heavenly Art, of drawing Light out of Darkneſs for mine own uſe; I have not been trampled upon for ſo many Years to ſo little purpoſe as to remain yet either ignorant or inſenſible of mine own Vileneſs, and to what Element I am neareſt allied, or ſo tender or querulous as either to complain of the weight of thoſe who ſtill go over me as the Stones in the Street, or to project the ſuffering of any Man in order to pleaſe or ſolace my ſelf, my long Deprivation and want of reſpects from ſome that ſhould have treated me as a Chriſtian, a Gentleman, and a Presbyter of the Church of God, is now turn'd into an Athletique habit, ſome what after the manner of thoſe, who through long Faſting loſe their Appetites, and withall either Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract or find an Ability or Contentedneſs of Nature,
<pb facs="tcp:56278:25"/>
to live with a little or no Meat afterwards; I can, through the Strength of Chriſt, ſuffer my ſelf to be oppreſſed, and from my poor Dunghil whereon I ſit, behold both Friends and Enemies, that with much Contentment, and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Enjoyment of my ſelf, partaking of the good Things of this Life, the more, becauſe that God ſtill preſerves your Royal Perſon from the Attempts that the Trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Conſpirators have ſo often made to deſtroy You and the Nation, from the intended Invaſion by our implacable Enemies, that would deſtroy and enſlave us.</p>
            <p>Next to Chriſt and this Truth, I ſhall, with the utmoſt Breath and Power I have, according to my Oath and Duty, in what Place and Station ſoever I am, endeavour to be found Loyal and True to your Majeſty, as my Rightful and Lawful Sovereign Lord and King, as all good Subjects and Chriſtians ought to be; and I cannot forbear, out of the great and ſincere Zeal and Affection that I bear to your Majeſty; bleſs God for the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord there is between your Majeſty and Proteſtant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which your Majeſty hath found to have turn'd to a good account to your Eaſe, Comfort and Peace, in the managing your Affairs of Government both in Church and State, and it is a great Comfort to your good Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſee your Majeſty relying upon your two Houſes of Parliament, for your neceſſary Eaſe and Help in this day of your Juſt War with the <hi>French Nimrod,</hi> and Deſtroyer of Mankind.</p>
            <p>It was a great Blemiſh in the two laſt Reigns to thoſe two Kings, for that rather than they would truſt in a Parliament, according to the fundamental Conſtitution
<pb facs="tcp:56278:25"/>
of this Realm, they choſe rather to follow the Advice of their never to be forgotten corrupt Miniſters of State, who pretended great Loyalty to thoſe Princes in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Reigns, or rather Compliance with the Humours and Humane Frailties of thoſe two Monarchs; but they were neither true to thoſe Kings nor their Country, or themſelves herein, for they erected and preferred an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Paramount, Self-end or Luſt, before all which thoſe two Kings were brought unworthily to ſerve and promote to the diſturbance of the Publick Peace and Welfare of the Nation. It was a falſe Suggeſtion that thoſe Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators did uſe to thoſe Kings, that a King that Rules by his Will is more great, glorious, or ſtrong, than a King that Rules by Law, the quality of the Retinue, beſt proves the State of the Lord, the one being but a King of Slaves, while the other, like God, is a King of Kings and Hearts, notwithſtanding that Helliſh and Trayterous Doctrin, made ſuch an Impreſſion upon the Hearts and Souls of thoſe Princes, that nothing prevented them from putting that ſort of Doctrin into Practice; but the want of a competent Stock, with which they would have certainly ſet up the Trade, eſpecially ſince they ſaw the Example of ſuch an Allie, whoſe Intereſt, and theirs was all one; but God that hath preſerved your Majeſty in ſo many Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, hath alſo preſerved you from ſuch wicked Councils and Councellors too, which is a great Specimen of your long and happy Reign over us.</p>
            <p>Sir, my Pen hath tranſgreſſed the Line and Law of my Intentions, theſe confined me to a much narrower Compaſs in this my <hi>Epiſtle Dedicatory</hi> to your Majeſty,
<pb facs="tcp:56278:26"/>
and prohibited me the troubling your Majeſty to ſuch a degree as now I have done; the truth is, my Zeal, Duty, Loyalty and hearty Affection to your Majeſty hath inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and occaſioned this Tranſgreſſion. Your Majeſty knows that Love is bountiful, and I truſt, will produce a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don from your Majeſty, as it hath brought forth this Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion from me, in which I have with all my Heart deſigned nothing but what may be conſiſtent with your Service and Intereſt: And, I muſt ſay thus much, that your Majeſty being thus often marked out for Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by theſe Conſpirators, ſhews, that your Majeſty is neither a Friend to theſe Men, nor their Principles, either in Religion, or in Politicks; and that we ought to make uſe of it as a proof of your Majeſty's Affections to the Engliſh Nation, and as an acknowledgment thereof, by me be pleaſed to accept of this poor Endeavour of mine, and give me leave in all Humility, to lay theſe Papers at your Royal Feet: Many of your Loyal Subjects are capable of preſenting your Majeſty with what is more Suitable to the greatneſs of your Underſtanding; but nothing can be laid before you that may ſatisfie your Majeſty of the truth of thoſe things which theſe Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators ſtood guilty of for theſe twenty Years laſt paſt, and have now given your Majeſty a plain demonſtration how Reſtleſs they have been, and ſtill are, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Arguments of Grace and Mercy that have been uſed to reduce them to Reaſon and Obedience.</p>
            <p>There is now no more danger (if your Majeſty plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) from theſe Men that have Conſpired againſt your Life; for the danger of Conſpiracies lyes in being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed;
<pb facs="tcp:56278:26"/>
none ever Periſhed by a detected Plot, but ſuch as have abandoned themſelves to be Deſtroyed; and this was the Caſe of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second; he choſe rather to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert himſelf and Safety, rather than the Diſcoverer ſhould not be expoſed to the implacable Malice of thoſe who Conſpired againſt his Perſon and Government. But Sir, with your Majeſty it is clear another thing, you will let the World know that you are not joyned in this Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy by any Perſonal Acceſſion, as that unhappy Prince was in that that was againſt him. Therefore Sir, it is paſt the Malice and Strength of your Adverſaries, either to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy your Royal Perſon, or ſubvert your Government: Beſides Sir, your Majeſty uſing thoſe Endeavours that becomes ſo great a Prince, to have theſe Conſpirators far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther detected and brought to Juſtice, puts your Majeſty within the promiſe of the immenſe Wiſdom and Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power to interpoſe, to ſave and preſerve you.</p>
            <p>I have great grounds of aſſurance that your Majeſty is fully ſatisfied of the Duty and Affection of your ever du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and Loyal Proteſtant Diſſenting Subjects, who have been for many Years Perſecuted for the Teſtimony of a good Conſcience, in the two laſt Reigns, for no other reaſon but becauſe they would not part with their Civil Rights as Engliſh Men, nor their Spiritual Rights as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, to theſe Murderers of the Soul and Body of the Nation. Nevertheleſs, in the two late Reigns they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued more quiet under their many and great Perſecutions and Oppreſſions, than the Conſpirators did under their daily Favours and Careſſes. The Principles of your Diſſenting Subjects teach them to obey a Lawful Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb facs="tcp:56278:27"/>
whilſt the Principles of theſe <hi>High-Church, Non-Juring</hi> and <hi>Popiſh Cut-throats,</hi> carry them on to Murder Kings, and Invade their Countries with a Foreign Force and Power. They could not find one of theſe Loyal Men that would ſo far undervalue themſelves as to have the leaſt acquaintance with theſe Villainous Cut-throats, much leſs to engage with them in ſuch a barbarous Deſign; and no Man queſtions, but that your Majeſty will now put a diſtinction between thoſe Men who would (if they might) ſerve your Majeſty, and thoſe who would have Traiterouſly deſtroyed your Perſon and ſubverted your Government, by introducing Popery and Slavery among us.</p>
            <p>That your Majeſty may long Live, to aſſert and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Laws; the Laws of the moſt High God in your own Soul to your Eternal, and the Laws of the Land to the Temporal high Peace and Felicity of your Majeſty and People, and abound in all the Bleſſings of this and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Life, Health, Grace, Wiſdom, Wealth, Power and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over all your Enemies, both at home and abroad, ſhall ever be the Prayers of</p>

            <p>THE Kingdom in general, and my ſelf in particular, having received ſo many indearing Obligations from you, and your Partiſans, that I judge my ſelf concerned to take notice to you, and your Friends at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> That ſince you left us, or rather, by the Juſt Judgment of Heaven, that the Kingdom was departed from you; you were pleaſed not to forget us, but from Year to Year, till 1693. you were pleaſed to bleſs your old Friends with a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Letter, in which you were pleaſed to expreſs your ſelf in a different ſtile: In ſome of your Papers you write your Heart and Soul <hi>in words at length, and not in figures;</hi> then it's your pleaſure that we are to know to what we are to truſt when ever you ſhall return to your Native Countrey, and enjoy your pretended Right. Sometimes you intimate, as if <hi>England</hi> were to be the Field of Blood, and that Man, Woman, and Child, ſhould be a Sacrifice to your Revenge, which made your little ſcoundrel Party here to prick up their Ears, and look as if a Leg or an Arm were not ſufficient to appeaſe your Wrath; or a <hi>Carts Arſe, or a Pillory,</hi> could not make ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to your ſelf, and Party, for the wrong you, and your Friends, have ſuffered from us; nothing leſs than death and damnation of the Honeſt Nobility, Gentry, and Commons of <hi>England,</hi> can attone for the delivering themſelves from your Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and the Oppreſſion they ſuffered from you, and you Inſolent Party: Nay, the poor Fiſhermen, men of <hi>Feverſham,</hi> muſt not eſcape your Fury, and Vengeance. But in your latter Papers you are pleaſed to expreſs your ſelf in ſofter terms; and the Vengeance threatned in one Year's Papers is huſhed up, and fairly laid to ſleep; and, I remember, in the laſt you are pleaſed to give us a <hi>French</hi> Grimaſs, and ſmile upon us, as if you were made up of nothing but Grace, Mercy and Peace, and unparallell'd Humility, in order to create in us a good thought of the bitterneſs of death being paſt, notwithſtanding you have in ſome of your former Papers given us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, That in regard you have ſuſtained ſuch Affronts from the People of <hi>England,</hi> you might juſtly have proceeded ſeverely with us; yet in your younger Papers you think fit by a more gentle Method to uſe means to regain us to your ſelf, which is the firſt Born of all the Cunning you, and your Friends at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> have been pleaſed to bleſs this Nation withal.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, it hath been your will and pleaſure not to give your ſelf the trouble of emitting any more Declarations of your good Intentions towards us for theſe two or three Years laſt paſt; therefore I do think fit to acquaint you, and your Truſty Friends and Councellors at your Court at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> that are now with you (for I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſome of your old Partiſans have) ſometime ſince left you) that you muſt have but a very mean and low opinion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, if you think ever to return
<pb facs="tcp:56278:28"/>
hither again upon the ſtrength of your laſt Bantering Paper, called, <hi>A Gracious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration to all your loving Subjects:</hi> For the People of <hi>England</hi> have not forgot, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well remember, That for divers Years in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, your dear Brother, that there was a horrid Deſign carried on by him, your ſelf, and your Party, to change the Lawful Government of <hi>England</hi> into an Abſolute Tyranny, and to convert the Eſtabliſhed Proteſtant Religion into down-right Popery, than both which there can be nothing more deſtructive, and contrary to the Law and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being of this Nation: And whilſt you your ſelf was pleaſed to uſurp the Throne, theſe Three Kingdoms were highly ſenſible with what violence you and your wicked Party overthrew our Laws, Liberties, and Religion; and what Ruin and Vengeance attended theſe poor Nations, notwithſtanding all your Oaths and Promiſes made to the contrary, in Council, and in a Packt Parliament, that met in <hi>May</hi> 1685. which as bad as it was, it could not keep pace with you, and your Popiſh Cut-throats, in your Intentions of enſlaving the People of theſe Kingdoms, and of totally overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Laws, Liberties, and Religion.</p>
            <p>Before I begin my deſigned Method of laying before you, yours, and the Practices of your Accomplices, to put you in mind of ſome Paſſages in your Brother's Reign, of which the Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> had juſt cauſe to complain, as worthy of your Conſideration; and when they did addreſs, they found it was to very little, or no purpoſe; for no redreſs could be obtained from him: And by whoſe Advice and Counſel ſuch Miſdemeanors were committed, your ſelf can beſt tell that it was your ſelf.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second was no ſooner reſtored, but contrary to the Expectation of all thoſe good men that were the Inſtruments of his Reſtauration, they found to their ſorrow, 1. That Juſtice was corruptly adminiſtred, and Offices appertaining to Juſtice dearly bought and ſold. 2. Benefices and Eccleſiaſtical Dignities unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily collated upon Men that deſerved no other Titles than of common Rogues and Cheats; Men that were many of them unskilful in the Word of Righteouſneſs, and others that were Perſons of unſound Principles, and of worſe Morals; their Doctrines tending highly to enſlave the Nation, and their Morals to debauch it. This was the Advice of an old Friend of yours, and a great-Prop of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> whoſe Counſel and Advice it was, <hi>To debauch the Kingdom of</hi> England, <hi>and make them Atheiſts, and then they would be ſoon good Papiſts.</hi> This was in the Year 1654. at which time you, and your Party, were but at a low ebb; but how much you pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued the Counſel of the old Cardinal, I leave all reaſonable and unbyaſſed Men to judge; and how your ſneaking Eccleaſtical Paraſites contributed towards it. It is plain enough to any man that will look back into thoſe Times, There was one <hi>Jones,</hi> your Chaplain, who you ruined, becauſe he would have contributed to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Proteſtant Religion in your Family, according to his Office and Calling of a Miniſter in the Church of God. You may remember by whom Biſhopricks, and other Eccleſiaſtical Dignities, were thus procured truly by your <hi>Popiſh ſelf, and Popiſh Whores; Popiſh Pimps, and Popiſh Bowds;</hi> and not without Money, or ſome Promiſe to favour your Catholick Deſigns; and how they ſuffered your <hi>quondam</hi> Conſort to apoſtatize to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is well known. But they poor Prelates are gone to their Places, and there let them remain till God ſhall reckon with them and others of that Oorder; for betraying of God's Cauſe, which they pretended to eſpouſe, tho in truth they were Enemies to him and his Goſpel.</p>

3. In the third place, They ſaw new Impoſitions daily invented and levied, and the Publick Treaſure of the Nation, and the Revenues, prodigally conſum'd. Sir, you know, how 200000 <hi>l.</hi> was ſpent, and in order to what; and the Parties that receiv'd the ſame were in a Conſpiracy againſt our Laws, Liberties, and Religion: And did not you your ſelf join in the waſting of the King's Treaſure; and procured great Summs of Money to be iſſued out of His Majeſty's Exchequer to keep your Prieſts, Jeſuits, Monks, and to find your <hi>Iriſh</hi> Officers with Subſiſtence-money, till that you ſhould have occaſion to make uſe of them for thoſe Ends and Purpoſes that might advance your Cauſe and wicked Purpoſes againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt, and the Proteſtant Religion. Well therefore might you, in your Speech to the Council, <hi>Feb.</hi> 6. 1684. call <hi>Charles</hi> the Second your kind and loving Brother; for he joined with you in thoſe wicked Deſigns and Purpoſes which you were carrying on to deſtroy and enſlave us, and too often took your Faults upon himſelf, to ſcreen you from the publick Juſtice of the Nation.</p>
            <p>4. They ſaw old Officers unjuſtly diſplaced, and men of baſe Quality unworthily advanced, by which Contrivance you, Sir, may very well remember, you created a great diſaffection in the King's beſt Friends, both of the old Nobility and Gentry, and others that had eſpouſed the King, your Brother's Quarrel, upon juſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Principles; and choſe rather to advance a parcel of <hi>baſe Iriſh Papiſts, and vile Frenchmen,</hi> to the great diſcouragement of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and thoſe that heartily would have ſerved the King, your Brother, upon <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtant Principles. It is well known, that ſome of thoſe you preferred were ſo inſolent, that when they came to have, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy great Places in the Miniſtry of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's Government, that they aſſumed to themſelves, by your direction, the Regal Power; treating in Matters of War and Peace with Foreign Miniſters and Ambaſſadors; giving Inſtructions to the ſaid King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Miniſters abroad, without communicating them to thoſe that ought to have been privy to the ſame, contrary to Law; and all this I can prove hath been done by your direction. How many honeſt Old Servants were diſplaced by the influence you had on the King, your Brother, ſome are yet alive to tell; eſpecially thoſe who were well affected to the Proteſtant Religion, and in Parliament had appeared for the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom, in oppoſition to Popery and Slavery.</p>
            <p>5. They ſaw King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second carried away with Vanities, and wholly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by his Whores. You may remember, that ſome of thoſe Whores you your ſelf put upon him; as <hi>Jenny Roberts,</hi> who was in part kept by you as a Spy upon him; and for this end, at your Command ſhe turned Papiſt; and when ſhe could be of no uſe to you, nor was conſtant to King <hi>Charles,</hi> you and he put her off, and left her to ſtarve: <hi>Cleveland</hi> and <hi>Poriſmouth,</hi> two Metropolitan Whores that governed him as they pleaſed; and what Sums of Money (through the aſcendency they had over him) they obtained from him, I ſhall not need to tell you; and how many Biſhopricks they diſpoſed of, we have not forgotten: And in all this, Sir, it is plain, you promoted them to advance your Cauſe and Intereſt.</p>
            <p>6. He entred into a League with <hi>England</hi>'s morta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56278:29"/>
and <hi>French</hi> Servants, whom we have nouriſhed and cheriſhed with all the Careſſes imaginable; and to the meaneſt <hi>Valet de chamber,</hi> or Contemptible Lacquey or Fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, who pretended to be but <hi>alamode de France,</hi> your Paraſites paid more reſpect to, than to our brave <hi>Engliſhmen;</hi> nay, ſo amorous too had your fine, but (debauched) Ladies been of a <hi>French</hi> Kick ſhaw, that they have even hugged them in their very Boſoms; and have lamented the loſs, tho but of the meaneſt <hi>French</hi> Skips; witneſs the Tears that fell from divers great Perſonages of the Feminine Sex, that on their Knees made ſupplication for that inſipid High way-man <hi>Du Vall,</hi> who at laſt, though with great difficulty, was hanged at <hi>Tyburn</hi> for Robberies committed on the Highway. It is true, he was a man of excellent Parts, and ſingular Learning, only he could neither Write nor Read.</p>
            <p>But had this been all, I ſhould not have mentioned this Particular. There wae more in this then ſome unthinking men at that time were aware of; for you, and your Accomplices made further ſteps to maintain this ſtrong Alliance with the <hi>French,</hi> our mortal Enemies; for you did not only introduce the Modes and Cuſtoms of <hi>France</hi> amongſt us, but the Yoke of <hi>France</hi> that muſt be put on too. I have heard of a cer certain Knight, called Sir <hi>James—</hi>that in a Coffe-houſe was heard to ſay, <hi>That it would never be well in</hi> England, <hi>till our King was as Abſolute as the King of France.</hi> He was an Alderman of <hi>London,</hi> and, Sir, your very humble Admirer; and at that time you had made a very gracious promiſe to him of obtaining of your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the great Park near <hi>Dublin</hi> for him, for the great Services he had done your ſelf, and the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt: And truly, Sir, he hath deſerved that Boon at your hands, were it but for the aforeſaid wiſe Saying of his; and had that Raſcal had but Brains ſuitable to his Impudence, a man might eaſily have taken him for one of the Chief of the Conſpirators with your ſelf, againſt the Religion, Laws, and Liberties of the People of <hi>England:</hi> This Fellow, I ſay, was an Alderman of <hi>London,</hi> and his Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was in the City; but by his Diſcourſe a man would have ſworn he had always lived with your Conſpirators at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, or at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> or with the <hi>French</hi> Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, an old Companion of yours, who thanked God, <hi>That his great King of</hi> France <hi>could ſend for his Head, and his Eſtate, when he pleaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bleſſed be God, Sir, your Reſidence is in that ſweet place of St. <hi>Germains,</hi> where you enjoy your ſelf, and Friends, in a moſt comfortable manner; and you have your health as well as if you had 100 Sail of Ships at your Devotion, and an Army of 50000 men, which is a mercy. I pray, let me ask you, What ſort of People are your <hi>French</hi> Neighbours? Is there not ſuch a ſlaviſh temper in thoſe poor Wretches as is aſtoniſhing?</p>
            <p>Juſt to ſuch a ſlaviſh and knaviſh Temper you were about to bring the People of this Nation to; your Conſpirators had made a conſiderable progreſs in this mighty Work; and had not Divine Providence interpoſed, you had compleated the ſame: Your Party, to compleat this Work, found out the only true way, which was firſt to enſlave our Souls, by ſubjecting them; and our Reaſon, to the blind Superſtition of the Church; for that Prieſt craft having once ſo far won upon <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> as to make them truſt and pin their Faith and Reaſon upon their Sleeves, they may after that bring them to any thing that they ſhall direct; and therefore, as in your Day, ſo in all Ages heretofore, nothing did ſhew more the Cunning of your <hi>Banditti,</hi> than to drive on theſe two together, <hi>Popery and Slavery;</hi> only ſometimes they have driven on
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56278:29"/>
the one by the other; ſometimes <hi>Popery</hi> led the Van to bring on <hi>French Slavery,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>French Slavery</hi> led the Van to bring on <hi>Popery.</hi> Your Friends well knew that <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery,</hi> like two Siſters, they go hand in hand; ſometimes one goes firſt, and ſometimes the other: In <hi>England</hi> your Council reſolved that <hi>Popery</hi> was to bring in <hi>Slavery;</hi> in <hi>Scotland, Slavery</hi> was to have brought in <hi>Popery;</hi> and this was done by our Prieſts blind admonition to the people, of obedience to our Governors, be it good they command, or be it evil; whatever they command, it muſt be obeyed: And what Nation ſoever came under the misfortune of being robb'd of their Rights and Liberties, it was chiefly brought to paſs by Prieſt-craft, in preaching up blind obedience, and extolling Vicious Kings, and calling them excellent, tho the vileſt of Tyrants, who were riding Poſt to ſwallow them up: This was the Practice of our Pulpit-hunters in the time of the Reign of your Brother, and in the beginning of your Uſurpation of the Government; and ſo they would have done to this day, had not the Tythe-pig been in danger: Nothing, I ſay, contributed more to the confirming and eſtabliſhing the late King your Brother's Alliances with <hi>France,</hi> as that progreſs your Prieſts and Jeſuits made in perverting the people, as to their Religion; and our Eccleſiaſtical Brokers debauching their Morals by their immorality, and looſeneſs of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and enſlaving their minds by their damnable Doctrines of Paſſive Obedience, and Non-reſiſtance, and the Divine Right of Succeſſion to the Imperial Crown of the Realm.</p>
            <p>7. He being fully reſolved to follow his Pleaſure, he left the Adminiſtration of the Three Kingdoms to your ſelf, and Cut-throat Party, who were Enemies to the people of <hi>England,</hi> and were in a damnable Conſpiracy againſt his perſon and Government, and the Proteſtant Religion. That he was reſolved upon his Pleaſures, you, nor no man can deny; and that you had the aſcendency of him, it is too plain and manifeſt to admit of the leaſt doubt or ſcruple: But that which was moſt wicked, you kept him plied with thoſe vile Wretches, who promoted that Vice in him. And tho he was the vileſt of all the Kings that went before, for his many Immoralities; yet how did his Eccleſiaſtical Paraſites flatter him, and admire him as a Prince of the greateſt Virtues; a King of Peace (they called him) and a King of Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>I am ſure he engaged the Government in two unjuſt Wars againſt the <hi>Dutch;</hi> and thanks be to God, he was by them worſted in both thoſe Wars; and it proved fatal to the Conſpirators; for the great Deſign of ruining the <hi>Dutch,</hi> was the advancement of Popery and Arbitrary Power here in <hi>England,</hi> which you durſt not attempt till they were weakened; you fearing their joining their Forces together to reſcue us from your damnable Deſigns againſt our Religion, Laws and Liberties, as you know they did, and that to very good purpoſe; the effects of which will not be gotten out of your old Bones as long as you live.</p>
            <p>Before I conclude this Head, give me leave, Sir, to obſerve, that whilſt the King, your Brother, was ſwallowed up in his Pleaſures, you, and your Minions, did make it your buſineſs to beget in the people a low opinion of the method of Governing; and by your Prieſts (you taking opportunity, by reaſon of our then villanous Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillars of the Church countenancing it in a very high manner) to beget in the people a mean opinion of the Proteſtant Religion, and Intereſt; and you may remember you gained not a few to your Party: Therefore, when we conſider our danger, we cannot but be aſtoniſhed at our deliverance: For had your <hi>Banditti</hi> been avowed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56278:30"/>
our danger might more eaſily have been conquered; for ſome, nay the moſt of them, when the Teſt came in force, quitted their Imployment at Court; amongſt them, Sir, your ſweet ſelf quitted the Office and Title of Lord High Admiral of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> but, Sir, you had gotten a Crew about you, that did undertake with you, to ruin and deſtroy the Government, which lay under no temptation of Religion; theſe joined their Forces and Intereſt againſt King and Kingdom, and truly, I think, our greateſt danger was from them.</p>
            <p>You having this fair opportunity of your Brother's being ſo addicted to his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and he leaving the Adminiſtration of Affairs to you, and your Hellborn Crew; it was a great wonder you did not ſtrike ſooner, and leap into the Chair an Age or two before the time you did: It's certain you came not in without Murther, and Murther would have been but Murther if it had been done ten or a dozen years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Truly, tho you had Villains that one would have thought were bad enough, yet you had not enough for ſo black a Deſign, as the overthrow of the Government, and the Proteſtant Religion; they were not, I ſay, ripe enough; your Popiſh Party at home were keen enough, but they wanted a good back to their edge; therefore, Sir, you fearing your ſtrength at home, you applied you ſelf abroad to the <hi>French</hi> King, he being indowed with all thoſe Qualities, which in a Prince may paſs for Vertues, but in any man of a private Station, they would be capital: He being a Champion for Popery and Arbitrary Power, with him you joined to ruin the Government, and the Proteſtant Religion, your damnable Conſpiracy being a Project every way ſuitable to the Inclination and Intereſt of that Bloody Monſter of Mankind. You may remember the Trayterous Correſpondencies you maintained with him, and he with you, by your moſt Excellent Secretary <hi>Coleman,</hi> who you honeſtly left to be hanged for that great piece of ſecret Service he did you in that time.</p>
            <p>8. We well remember how careleſs he was in the maintenance of our Religion. Truly when Princes are given up to their Pleaſures, it is no great matter what Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion they profeſs; you may well call to mind what breaches you and your Party made upon our Religion through his careleſneſs and remiſneſs; how you advanced the Popiſh Intereſt, and diſcountenanced the Proteſtants; and as your Secretary <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> obſerved, that you would not forget the Tricks the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> had playd with you; ſo we cannot but remember what Tricks you plaid with us; for it is plain, that there was not a conſiderable Preferment in the Church that fell, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he that was preferred was one of no Religion, or elſe that which was worſe, he was a perſon that engaged in your unrighteous Cauſe and Quarrel.</p>
            <p>Sir, by your means, and the means of your Partiſans, ſuch men were made uſe of in the Church, that through the ignorance and inſufficiency of ſome of them, and oſcitancy and remiſneſs of others, to whom the Guardianſhip of her was committed, our Religion and Worſhip became lamentably diſmantled, misfigured and defaced, and this well nigh in all the integral and principal parts of it (more or leſs); inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that a man that underſtands the Doctrines, and holy Intentions of our firſt Reformers from the Synagogue of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſhall compare things with things, could, nor yet can hardly be able to ſay this is the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
            <p>But how can any man wonder that King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second ſhould be careleſs in the ſupport and maintenance of our Reformed Religion, ſince that he was in his heart and ſoul engaged to the Doctrines and Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:56278:30"/>
witneſs his being reconciled to that Church by Father <hi>Richard Huddleſton,</hi> who was related to <hi>John Huddleſton,</hi> of whom the ſaid King <hi>Charles</hi> had ſuch a tender care; and not only ſo, but Receiv'd the Sacrament from Father <hi>Ireland</hi> the Jeſuit, in the Ducheſs of <hi>Portſmouth</hi>'s Lodgings, and the ſame day afterwards he receiv'd it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Uſage of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> it being the <hi>Sunday</hi> called <hi>Eaſter-day.</hi> In the laſt place, witneſs thoſe Papers that were found under his own hand in his Strong Box, all which teſtify his inclinations were bent that way; and therefore how can any man wonder at his being careleſs of ſupporting the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>Nay, Sir, I muſt not forget one Inſtance more of his being of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; that is, that moſt Excellent Memorial that he put in by his Proteſtant Envoy to the Court at <hi>Poland;</hi> wherein there was a paſſage to this effect, <hi>That he had a great Eſteem of the</hi> Roman-Catholick <hi>and</hi> Apoſtolick <hi>Religion, as being moſt conſiſtent with Monarchy;</hi> give me leave to Cite a paſſage of a Letter of his to the Governor of St. <hi>Omers,</hi> when it was by Conqueſt reduced to the Obedience of the <hi>French</hi> King; which was, <hi>That he ſhould take care of the Jeſuits according to the Contract he had made with his Maſter, they being men upon whom the hopes of</hi> England <hi>did depend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Give me leave, Sir, to put you in mind of his promiſes he made to the Jeſuits in <hi>Spain</hi> after he was reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (upon their Contributing Three thouſand Piſtols for his ſupport) of reſtoring the Catholick Religion when ever he ſhould come to the Enjoyment of his Right in <hi>England;</hi> and not only to them, but to the Nuns in <hi>Ghent</hi> when he borrowed Money of them, for which they waited ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Years; Then I ſay, he declared he would reſtore their Religion when ever he ſhould come to his Right. When the Princeſs <hi>Henrietta</hi> came to <hi>Dover,</hi> you know what her Errand was to preſs the King to reſtore the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion here in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi> and that the breach of the Peace with the <hi>Dutch</hi> was then and there contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by you and your Conſpirators and conſented to by the King, and all in order to the reducing thoſe State to the Catholick Faith: And it was determined to begin the Publick Exerciſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and to facilitate that work, you may well remember who was ſent over Lord Lieutenant. Upon all theſe Conſiderations a Man may not now wonder at King <hi>Charles</hi>'s careleſneſs in the Support and Maintenance of the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
            <p>You well remember that you your ſelf and your other Conſpirators had begot in the King your Brother a full perſuaſion of the Truth of this Propoſition, That the <hi>Roman-Catholicks</hi> were the greateſt favourers of Monarchy; therefore in his Letter to the <hi>French</hi> King, bearing Date <hi>June</hi> 1676. that he reſolved to be like his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in Religion; but you know that he was prevented by the Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> and the Parliament, for which you were pleaſed to tell Father <hi>Lacheiſe,</hi> in your Letter of <hi>July.</hi> 1676. that the Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> and others by a Thouſand deceits endeavoured to break the good Intelligence that was betwixt the King, your Brother, and his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, and your ſelf, to the end they might deceive you all Three; and therefore the Parliament, and the ſaid Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> and his party were by you declared in that Letter as uſeleſs and dangerous, for that the ſaid <hi>Arlington</hi> and his Friends did work inceſſantly to advance the Intereſt of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and to leſſen the Intereſt of the <hi>French</hi> King. Now the King, your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being a man unſteady in his reſolutions, he ſometimes failed your Brother of <hi>France,</hi> as well as your ſelf, and other Conſpirators.</p>

9. We in his Life-time ſaw there was no likelihood of his having any legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Iſſue to Succeed him in the Government; Truly, Sir, I think I may ſay that was contrived by your Father <hi>Clarendon,</hi> and your ſelf, and in it you intended the hurt of the People of <hi>England;</hi> but God, who governs the World, hath made his want of legitimate Iſſue to be the greateſt Bleſſing that ever <hi>England</hi> ſaw; for by that means we have a King that well knows that it is moſt certain and evident to all men, that the publick Peace and Happineſs of any State or Kingdom, cannot be preſerved where the Laws, Liberties, and Cuſtoms Eſtabliſhed by the Lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in it are openly Tranſgreſſed and Annulled; more eſpecially when the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Religion is endeavoured, and that a Religion which is contrary to Law is endeavoured to be introduced: Upon which, thoſe who are immediately concerned in it are indiſpenſably bound to endeavour to Preſerve and Maintain the Eſtabliſhed Laws, Liberties and Cuſtoms, and above all the Religion and Worſhip of God that is Eſtabliſhed among them; and to take ſuch an effectual care that the Inhabitants in that State or Kingdom may not be deprived of their Religion, nor of their Civil Rights, which is ſo much the more neceſſary, becauſe the Greatneſs and Security both of Kings and Royal Families, and of all ſuch as are in Authority, as well as the Happineſs of their Subjects and People, depend in a moſt eſpecial manner upon the exact Obſervation and Maintenance of theſe their Laws, Liberties, and Cuſtoms. This, Sir, is the Sentiment and Bleſſed Reſolution of King <hi>William;</hi> and this he and his Miniſters put in Execution, which is a bleſſed Change, which we could not have lived to enjoy, had <hi>Charles</hi> your Brother left any Iſſue behind him that had been capable of the Crown; but that which you contrived for our Miſchief, is turned to our greateſt Good, for we have the beſt of Kings upon the Throne, and the worſt of Men taking of the Air at St. <hi>Germains.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. The late King <hi>Charles,</hi> your Brother, did obſtinately refuſe to enter into a League with thoſe who intended to uphold and maintain the Proteſtant Religion: This I muſt ſay of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that ever ſince they delivered themſelves from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable Yoke of the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> their great aim and deſign hath been to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Intereſt of the Reformed Religion, and have endeavoured to make Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances with thoſe Princes that were, and are of the Reformed Religion, and have endeavoured to make good theſe Alliances; but how King <hi>Charles</hi> your Brother, your ſelf, and the reſt of your Partiſans, treated the <hi>Dutch</hi> ever ſince his Reſtoration to the Crown, it is well known, and how he in the compaſs of Ten years made Two ungodly Wars; but as I ſaid before, I muſt ſay again, The <hi>Dutch</hi> did moſt commonly ſend us home with broken bones. Our Cauſe was Wicked, and God gave us Succeſs ſuitable thereunto; and for what ends and purpoſes theſe Wars were made, you, and your moſt Chriſtian Brother can very well tell; but leaſt, Sir, you ſhould have forgotten thoſe Wars, give me leave to give you a brief note of them.</p>
            <p>In the year 1665. it is well known that a War was made upon the <hi>Dutch;</hi> I could wiſh it were as well remembred what the provocation was that occaſioned it, and what ſucceſs it had. I think, Sir, as I ſaid juſt now, the ſucceſs was ſuitable; in the firſt fight you had the Command of the Fleet; and truly it was a Victory you obtained; but how came we of at <hi>Bergon,</hi> and how in the year 1666. when Monk had the Command? your Conſpirators got vaſt ſupplies from your Band of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners

for the defraying the charge of this wicked War, yet after all there was no Fleet ſet out in the year 1667. but the Flower of the Royal Navy burnt or taken in Port to ſave charges; but you know your Brother and your ſelf had good health of Body at <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> when you had no Ships, and therefore you were the leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
            <p>But that which is the greateſt Riddle to ſome of your Conſpirators, Why the <hi>French</hi> ſhould at that time a day join with the <hi>Dutch</hi> againſt <hi>England?</hi> Therefore be pleaſed to remember that the <hi>French</hi> did not join with the <hi>Dutch</hi> to Support and Maintain the Proteſtant Religion, or to advance the Intereſt of the <hi>Dutch;</hi> but whilſt he was in Friendſhip with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> he had an interrupted leiſure (tho' contrary to all Oaths and Treaties) whilſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> and we were embroiled to Invade the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> which had been by Wiſe men conſidered as the natural Frontier of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and took a great part of it. The <hi>Dutch</hi> could not oppoſe him becauſe of the pretended Alliance; We could not interpoſe becauſe we were engaged both againſt the <hi>Dutch, Dane,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> ſo he went forth Conquering, and to Conquer that part of the Dominion of <hi>Spain,</hi> to whom, Sir, your Brother and your ſelf were very much obliged when never a Prince in all <hi>Europe</hi> durſt own you, he did; and how baſely your Brother, and your ſelf, and Conſpirators have treated him, let all <hi>Europe</hi> judge.</p>
            <p>But what was the reaſon we had not a Fleet ſet out in the year 1667. ſince ſuch large Supplies were obtained for to carry on this ungodly War againſt the <hi>Dutch?</hi> The reaſon was this; notwithſtanding he had joined with the <hi>Dutch</hi> againſt us, yet by the Credit he had with the Queen your Mother, he by her ſo far deluded the King your Brother, that upon the aſſurance the <hi>Dutch</hi> would not have any Fleet out that year, he forbore to make ready, and ſo incurred that notable loſs and diſgrace at <hi>Chatham.</hi> This was the fatal end of all our Sea-undertakings againſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> for that War; and as the <hi>French</hi> King, and your ſelf, and Conſpirators were the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom we were much obliged for that War, ſo we were glad to receive Peace from his favour, which was agreed at <hi>Breda</hi> betwixt <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, what was the Event of this Peace, which, if I am not out, we were forced to pay for it, for we ſtood in need of it, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſtood in need of our Money, which they had; but the Event of this War brought the King to ſome little conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, of which he was ſeldom guilty, for he ſaw that the <hi>French</hi> King had in the year 1667. taken the time of us; and whilſt we were both made weak, he had play'd his Pranks in the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> hereupon he judgeth it neceſſary to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe before the flame that conſumed his next Neighbour ſhould throw its Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles over the Herring-Pond and affect him.</p>
            <p>Therefore, he having ſome good Counſellors about him (you may well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that neither you, nor your Conſpirators, had any hand in this affair) he gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly ſlighted all Punctilios of Ceremony, or Piques of Animoſity, for being ſo well beaten, and ſo horribly diſgraced: He ſent firſt into <hi>Holland,</hi> and invites them to a nearer Alliance, and to enter into ſuch farther Counſels as were moſt proper to quiet this publick diſturbance the <hi>French</hi> had raiſed. This work was wholly deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the King, your Brother, and thoſe few honeſt Counſellors he had left him; and it being ſo good a work, it did ſucceed; accordingly you by this, Sir, may
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56278:32"/>
ſee what felicity attends that King who follows the Counſels of Honeſt Wiſe Men, and excludes the corrupt Politicks of Rogues that aim at nothing but the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of themſelves and Families, tho' it be upon the ruin of their Countrey; for it is a thing ſcarce credible, tho' very true, that two Treaties of ſuch Weight and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricacy, and various aſpect as that of the Defenſive League with <hi>Holland,</hi> and the other for repreſſing of the further Progreſs of the <hi>French</hi> in the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> ſhould in five days time in the year 1668 be concluded, when yours, and the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks of your Conſpirators were excluded. Such was the ſecreſy and expedition then uſed in proſecuting the King, your Brother's, Inſtruction; and ſo eaſy a thing it is for Princes when they have a mind to it, to be well ſerved. You may remember that the <hi>Swede</hi> alſo ſhortly made the third in this Conſort, whether wiſely judging that in the Minority of their King Reigning over late acquired Dominions, it was their true Intereſt to have their hands in all the Councils that tended to Peace and Undiſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Poſſeſſion: Or whether indeed thoſe Miniſters, like ours, did even project in ſo glorious an Alliance to betray it afterward to their own greater advantage, from their joining in it, it was called the Tripple Alliance; the King, you know, was ſo fond of it, that he ceaſed not to ſollicite other Princes, according to the Seventh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of that Treaty, to come into the Guaranty of the ſame, and he extremely for a time delighted himſelf in cultivating by all good means what he by the Counſel of ſome good men had ſo happily planted; and what ſatisfaction this Tripple League ſo made, gave to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and how it did charm the more ready Votes of the Houſe of Commons into a Supply, and juſtify the neceſſity of it in the very face of the whole Kingdom: For it was of ſo good report, and ſo generally acceptable to the Proteſtant Party, as being a Hook in the <hi>French</hi> Noſtrils, that the Penſionary Parliament (who were wont, whether it were for War or Peace to make the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion pay for it) could not have deſired a fairer pretence to colour their Liberality.</p>
            <p>You know, Sir, what vaſt ſums were obtained and laviſhed in the firſt War with <hi>Holland;</hi> that Parliament in the Month of <hi>April</hi> 1670. giving the Additional Duties up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Wines for eight years, which did amount to Five hundred and Sixty thouſand pounds, and confirmed the ſale of the Fee-Farm Rents, which was no leſs their gift, being a part of the publick Revenue, to the value of Eighteen hundred thouſand pounds; nay, not only ſo, but they met again upon the 24th of <hi>October</hi> in the year 1670. and upon the Speech of the Lord Keeper <hi>Bridgman,</hi> who telling the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment what a multitude of Beneficial Leagues the King had made, and naming to them the Tripple League, they could no longer hold, gave again a Subſidy of One ſhilling in the pound, to the real value of all Lands, and other Eſtates proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, with ſeveral more Beneficial Clauſes into the Bargain, to begin the 24th of <hi>June,</hi> 1671. and to expire the 24th of <hi>June</hi> 1672. together with this they gave the additional Exciſe upon Beer and Ale for Six years, to reckon the ſame from <hi>June</hi> the 24th. 1671. And laſtly, the Law-Bill commencing from the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> 1671. and at nine years end to determine. If you, now you are at leiſure, will caſt up theſe Three Bills, you will find them not a penny leſs than 2500000 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, you may ſee what a Reputation this Tripple League gave the King, your Brother, both at home and abroad; at home this Triple League obtained a Tripple ſupply, which ſome men thought would as with three Golden Nails have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetted it. All the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> courted him abroad, and were highly pleaſed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56278:32"/>
with it; the Emperor uſed all the preſſing means that became him, that he might partake of the benefit of that Alliance, and was refuſed.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorain,</hi> who had been always a true Friend to your Brother, and your ſelf, and by his affection to the Tripple League, did incur the diſpleaſure of the <hi>French</hi> King, and loſt his whole Territory: It was ſeized in the Year 1669. againſt all Laws, not only of Peace, but of Hoſtility too, becauſe of his not being admitted into the Alliance; for which he had ſo great a regard, that the honour he had for it proved fatal to him; he was left by your means to be a Sacrifice, notwithſtanding King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Invitation of all Princes to come in; yet when they deſired to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, they were refuſed.</p>
            <p>But in a ſhort time, all thoſe Honeſt Counſels which had taken effect with ſo great ſatisfaction to the Nation, and to the great honour of your Brother, were all changed; juſt as if Treaties, as ſoon as the Wax is cold, do loſe their vertue; the King, your Brother, went down to <hi>Dover</hi> in the Month of <hi>June,</hi> 1670. to meet, after a long Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, Madam, his, and your only remaining Siſter; and if the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> were alive, they could tell what a pleaſant Meeting they had, and how pleaſantly they paſſed the time of the interview; and what paſſed I ſhall not now relate, you knowing all of it well enough: But as the days were the more pleaſant, becauſe the King had not ſeen her for a long ſeaſon; ſo the Interview proved fatal to that Princeſs; for though ſhe left <hi>England</hi> in good health, yet upon her arrival in <hi>France,</hi> ſhe ſuddenly expires.</p>
            <p>Well then, ſhe dies, what was the conſequence of her death? The Marqueſs <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonds</hi> is immediately diſpatched hither, and a Perſon of great Honour ſent to the Court of <hi>France;</hi> and before ever the inquiry and grumbling at her death was over, in a trice there was an inviſible League, in prejudice of the Tripple one, ſtruck up with <hi>France,</hi> to all the height and dearneſs of affection; as if upon diffecting the Princeſs, there had been ſome <hi>State-Philtre</hi> been found in her Bowels, or the Reconciliation with <hi>France</hi> were not to be celebrated with a leſs Sacrifice than the Blood Royal of <hi>England.</hi> The ſequel of this Interview was fatal to the Princeſs; and the conſequence of her coming was fatal to <hi>England;</hi> for as the Treaty was a work of darkneſs, and could not preſently be diſcovered; ſo the Parliament, I told you, muſt meet again, to give a Tripple Supply to maintain the Tripple League; and they being ignorant of what was done, thinking all had been ſecure, gave the aforeſaid ſupply.</p>
            <p>Sir, You got the Supply; what uſe did your Conſpiritors make of it? Was not the Parliament prorogued, and met not again till the 4th of <hi>Febr.</hi> 1672. by which means you, and your Accomplices, had a convenient ſcope for the <hi>mighty work</hi> you had upon your hands to ruin the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and the Profeſſors thereof; and that you might be free from the inſpection of a Parliament till this mighty Work was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, I obſerved to you, That the King, your Brother, before the Interview, was inciting of the Princes to come into the Alliance, but from hence forward it ceaſed; and, as I ſaid before, when any did offer themſelves, they were baſely refuſed.</p>
            <p>Oh! what joy, Sir, you, and the reſt of the Conſpirators, did conceive! with what diligence was <hi>Smith,</hi> the Jeſuits Agent in <hi>London,</hi> diſpatched over to St. <hi>Omers</hi> to acquaint your Friends there of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Jeſuits; and from thence to <hi>Doway,</hi> to acquaint the Crew there in what a happy way you were in to do the Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſervice, and that the King was clearly come over; he having promiſed to do all
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56278:33"/>
things now that might tend to the deſtroying of the Intereſt of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Power and Intereſt of <hi>France;</hi> and if that the Tripple League were once diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, the King, your Brother, would never more make any ſuch Alliance with thoſe Rebels. I have ſeen your Letters diſpatched by the ſaid <hi>Smith:</hi> You indeed, with the help of your Helliſh Crew, your Brother being gained to your ſide in this particular you reſolve upon the annulling of that Alliance, which was of very little uſe; for ſome time before it was totally diſſolved.</p>
            <p>In order to the diſſolving this Treaty, old <hi>Henry Coventry,</hi> one of your Conſpir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, was diſpatched to the Court of <hi>Sweden;</hi> and he with as much impudence as truth, affirmed at his departure, That the end of his Journey to <hi>Sweden</hi> was to break the Tripple League; and this is apparent, that after his jugling with the <hi>French</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters there, and the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> the ſaid King did never more proſecute the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and ends of that Alliance, until the breach between us and the <hi>Dutch;</hi> What, did he arm himſelf at the expence of the League, and did firſt, under the diſguiſe of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, act the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, and at laſt he threw off the Vizor, and drew his Sword in their Quarrel.</p>
            <p>Truly, Sir, I cannot but admire how ſucceſsful you were in gaining that great Point of ruining <hi>Europe</hi> in general, and this Nation in particular; by this way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning the utter ſubverſion of the Proteſtant Religion, and all our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberties, as I ſhall ſhew you in the ſequel of this <hi>Memento:</hi> Nevertheleſs, I cannot but much more admire, that Mr. <hi>Coventry,</hi> that in his Embaſſy at <hi>Breda</hi> was ſo inſtrumental in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a period to that firſt wicked and unfortunate War with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> ſhould at length be made a Tool of a Second, and break ſuch an Alliance as rendered <hi>England</hi> honourable to all <hi>Europe,</hi> and by which all Chriſtendom was faſtened: And that which rendered his Carriage in that Affair more vile and baſe, ſince no man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Theory and Practick of Honour better than himſelf, and yet could in ſo eminent an Inſtance forget it, and himſelf too, the imployment being more fit for a <hi>Butler,</hi> or a <hi>Downing,</hi> or ſome ſuch Dunghil Raſcal; all that I ſhall ſay in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, is, that upon his return he was made a Secretary of State by your procurement, for ſuch a ſet of Deviliſh Services that he had done for the <hi>French</hi> King, the King your Brother, and your ſelf; by this means he had made a Tripple Confederacy to ruin us, in oppoſition to a Tripple League that might have preſerved us, and all <hi>Europe</hi> in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect peace. If my poor Judgment might paſs, Mr. <hi>Conventry,</hi> if he had continued an honeſt Gentleman, he might have been an Inſtrument of good to <hi>Europe,</hi> and more honourable here at home.</p>
            <p>But this Gentleman was not the only Sinner that was imployed in the Devil's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; for Sir <hi>William Lockyard,</hi> and ſeveral others, were diſpatched to other Courts upon the ſame Errand. This <hi>Lockyard</hi> was grown as great a Villain as your heart and ſoul could deſire; and had in the baſeſt manner proſtituted himſelf to do your Popiſh Drudgery; and would have gone along with it to the utmoſt tedder of your Deſigns.</p>
            <p>Well then, what was next to be done? Your Deſigns looked with as fair an aſpect as your heart and ſoul could deſire: You had <hi>France,</hi> your Brother, and your ſelf, linked together, that a man would have thought you could not have been parted; what then is the next Intention? truly a War with the <hi>Dutch;</hi> and that you might reaſonably expect, for all your Affairs were diſpoſed towards it. Here, Sir, I muſt remind you of two things. 1. What you did to procure a War. 2. What you did to carry on that ſecond wicked War.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:56278:33"/>
1. What you, and your Conſpirators did, to procure a War with the <hi>Dutch.</hi> For it cannot be conceived, that after the King had made ſo firm a League with the <hi>States-General</hi> of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> but that therefore you, and your Councellors muſt have ſome fair Pretence for breaking with them; or elſe to ſpill ſo much Blood, and ſpend ſo much Treaſure without cauſe, muſt occaſion your Neighbours to think you were men that would keep no Faith, or that you did not underſtand your own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; nay, they muſt have thought the ſame of all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation; but that they well knew, that this ſecond, as well as the firſt War, was againſt the Judgment, and Genius, and Intereſt of the Nation in general. But a War you would have: And therefore,</p>
            <p n="1">1. You ſet up a <hi>Si quis,</hi> if any one could give Evidence for you, and the reſt of the Conſpirators, againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> let them come forth, and they ſhould be heard; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an <hi>O yes</hi> was made, and the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company was ſent for, to know what they had to ſay againſt the <hi>Dutch;</hi> but the <hi>Dutch</hi> had ſo punctually performed the Treaty at <hi>Breda,</hi> and eſpecially as to the honour of the Flag that nothing could be objected againſt them; ſo here you failed of your aims of picking a quarrel with them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You would have quarrelled with them for having their Fleet abroad; tho that Objection vaniſhed, their Fleet was upon their own Coaſts, purſuant to the Tripple League, and in proſecution of that Treaty; ſo, Sir, you failed here. But what then? you was reſolved upon a War, and therefore you would not leave one Stone unturned, but you would find ſome cauſe or another to ruin, if it had been in your power, that Proteſtant State.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You were put upon a third Experiment; to commence a War, and to make a Caſe which never happened before, or could have been imagined by any ſober man, you had a pimping Yatcht, which you cauſed to bear an <hi>Engliſh Jack</hi> in the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1671. which you ordered to ſail into the midſt of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled out the Admiral, and ſhot twice at him; which Action was certainly very ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and unnatural, as for a Lark to adventure upon a Hawk: Notwithſtanding this impudent Action of the Commander of the Scoundrel Boat, the Admiral, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his Majeſty's Colours, paid our Yatch-Admiral a viſit, to know the reaſon of ſuch a Carriage, found it was becauſe the <hi>Dutch</hi> had refuſed to ſtrike Sail to his little Bum-boat; the <hi>Dutch</hi> Admiral excuſed the matter with all the civility that could be deſired, it being a Caſe of the firſt impreſſion; and therefore he could have no Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions as to that Point; and therefore, as it became him, he promiſed he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint his Maſters in the Affair, and take their directions, and ſo they parted; and the noble Commander, with his Oyſter Boat, returned, being fraught with the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel for which he was ſent, which yet was for ſome time paſſed over here in ſilence, without any complaint, or demand of ſatisfaction; but your Conſpirators were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to improve it afterwards: When the Conſpiracy againſt thoſe Proteſtant States was ready to take effect, then this Point began to be debated, and a reaſon for the intended wicked War. The Conſpirators aſſigned the <hi>Dutch</hi> had not vailed their Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dung-boat, it carrying the King's moſt Excellent <hi>Jack;</hi> tho it is plain, the <hi>Dutch</hi> had all along, both at home and here, as carefully endeavoured to give, as the Conſpirators, that were Miniſters, to avoid the receiving all manner of ſatisfaction: Nay, our Villains would not ſo much as let the <hi>States-General</hi> know what would be received and owned as ſatisfaction; nay, they were ſo afraid that the <hi>Dutch</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:56278:34"/>
would comply in the buſineſs of the Flag, and by that means the Rogues ſhould be diſappointed of a hopeful War, the Clock was ſet forward ſome minutes; ſo that by their roguery they did happily obtain a War: And what joy there was at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and amongſt your Prieſts, ſome of whom were ſo drunk, that the news they wrote of this Breach with the <hi>Dutch</hi> in their Letters, could not be read: And it's well known, that upon the arrival of the News, <hi>Te Deum</hi> was ſung very devoutly at the Queen's Chappel at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and Money ordered by the Queen for to be diſtributed to poor Catholicks; a token of Joy and Thankſgiving.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Pictures and Medals, This was another Pretence which you, and your <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditti</hi> took up to commence a War againſt the <hi>Dutch;</hi> but your Conſpirators handled this Point very nicely, fearing the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould give them ſatisfaction in this very Point, and thereby prevent a War. It is very plain that the <hi>Dutch</hi> were not conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to themſelves of any Provocation given to <hi>England;</hi> but did ſolemnly proteſt, That if any provocation were given by them, (nay, they went ſo far, that they were ready to make ſatisfaction for Offences taken) the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould make their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. You, Sir, and the reſt of the Conſpirators againſt the Proteſtant Religion, do accuſe them of theſe Medals and Pictures; what then, Muſt you have a War? I confeſs, I have read of a Poet, by a daſh of his Pen, was the Cauſe of a War againſt <hi>Poland;</hi> but that, Sir, was the firſt time that ever a Painter could by the ſtroke of his Pencil occaſion the breach of ſo conſiderable a League as was made with the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. To fill up the meaſure of the Iniquity of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> they bring in againſt them the Charge of detaining ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Families in <hi>Surinam,</hi> after the dominion of that Colony by treaty of Peace was ſurrendered up to the <hi>Hollander.</hi> What a noiſe you, and the reſt of the Conſpirators made about this Buſineſs! for upon the ſtrict exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Buſineſs, It was found that there was no ſuch thing as the detaining of any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Families, but leave only given them to abide there, if they pleaſed: Nay, when that Firſt-born of all Roguery and Villany, <hi>Baniſter</hi> himſelf, who was one of your <hi>Banditti,</hi> whom you had imployed as an Agent and Contriver of all this Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding in all that Affair, could not at laſt forbear to cry ſhame of it.</p>
            <p>Can you, Sir, reflect upon theſe things without bluſhing? Ought you not, now you have time, to think and conſider the invalidity of all theſe Allegations? Were theſe the Pillars that you made uſe uſe of to add ſtrength? And were Medals ſufficient to give weight, and Pictures colour for ſuch an Enterprize as this? But this is nothing, a War you, and your Conſpirators, were reſolved upon; and therefore a <hi>Manifeſto</hi> was on <hi>March</hi> 17. 1671/2 publiſhed, all theſe Crying Sins of the <hi>Dutch</hi> were made publick, and War proclaimed; and with what joy to the Conſpirators, and with what grief to the good People of <hi>England,</hi> Chriſtendom well knows.</p>
            <p>You, and your Partiſans, did, I ſay, rejoyce, but what was the conſequence of that wicked Rupture proclaimed on that fatal 17th day of <hi>March,</hi> but your making your ſelf, and your deviliſh Party, Principals to all the Horrid Deſtruction, Devaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Ravage and Slaughter, which from that aforeſaid 17th of <hi>March,</hi> 1672. that hath been continued to this very Year of 1696.</p>
            <p>2. I come to remind you with what you did to carry on that wicked War; and here the heads of your Rogues were hard at work, for there was great need of good conſideration in the Affair; for if I am not much out in my memory, the King, your Brother, was Two Millions in debt, notwithſtanding the vaſt Sums of Money he had
<pb facs="tcp:56278:34"/>
obtained by the ſtrength of the Tripple League, which he had ſo baſely broke and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved. What therefore ſhall we do for Money? your People had ſeveral Projects on foot; but there were four reſolved on, and put in execution.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Conſpirators were to try their utmoſt Efforts with the <hi>French</hi> King, who had made them mighty Promiſes of his Purſe, and Credit, to extirpate the <hi>Dutch-States,</hi> and by this had decoyed you into the War; But what was your Succeſs, I pray? Truly you were not ſo ſucceſs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ul as you expected; the Aid he contributed was but narrow, and could go but a little way in the managing of ſo great a War; for all the whole Revenue, and the <hi>French</hi> Contribution, could not laſt ten Months War; even this your Conſpirators foreknew, and therefore they reſolve upon a ſecond Project.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſhutting up the Exchequer, into which you, and your Friends, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyed in the wealthy Goldſmiths, and they the reſt of the Nation, by due payment of Intereſt, till you had run the King in debt two Millions, no body can certainly tell upon what occaſion, but your ſelf, your Prieſts, and other Conſpirators; but then your Reſolution was taken, that not one penny ſhould be expended otherwiſe than to carry on your Holy War for the pious Catholick Uſes, to which the Conſpirators had dedicated the ſame. This Reſolution of yours, and your Party, was carried on with all the Secrecy that became ſo black a Deſign, that you might not by venting it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably ſpoil the wit and malice of it; you on a ſudden, upon the 1ſt of <hi>January,</hi> 1670/1 for a New-Year's Gift to the Kingdom, to the great aſtoniſhment, ruin and deſpair of Intereſted Perſons, and to the terror of the whole Nation by ſo Arbitrary a Fact; the Proclamation iſſued, whereby the Crown, amidſt the confluence of ſuch great Supplies, publiſhed it ſelf a Bankrupt, and made Prize of the Subject, and broke all Faith and Contract at home, in order to break with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and to carry on the War with more advantage.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, your Politicks failed you here; for the Sum you obtained by this Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Cheat upon the People, did not anſwer the Expectation of your Party, nor the Ends for which the Rapine was committed: I find that you were ſtill ſtraitned, and the War could not be carried on with that application that was requiſite, without a far greater Sum than that which was afforded you by this courſe you took.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Therefore, in the third place, your Councellors put you upon ſhewing your ſelf a moſt Impartial Robberr; for after this Exploit, of ſhutting up the Exchequer, was ſo bravely managed, you reſolve that the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould furniſh you with Wealth for that Pious Deſign: The <hi>Dutch,</hi> you may remember, were not conſulted with in that Affair, therefore they continued to purſue their Traffick and Navigation through our Seas with the leaſt ſuſpicion of being Pyrats; and accordingly a very great and Rich Fleet of Merchant-men from <hi>Smyrna</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> were on their Voyage home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bound, near the <hi>Iſle of Weight,</hi> under the ſmall Convoy of five or ſix of their Men of War: Had it not been for this Fleet, the War had broke out much ſooner; but oh, how you, and your Pirats, hugg'd your ſelves with the hopes of enjoying the Riches that was on board them! this Fleet you imagined would put you in ſtock for the carrying you on in all the Wickedneſs that you, and your Party, were capable of; and that you ſhould never, after the obtaining of this Prize, ſtand in need again of, or fear a dangerous and uſeleſs Parliament: But how did the Deſign of Plundering and Robbing your Neighbours, in time of Peace, proſper the carrying on of your wicked War?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:56278:35"/>
Be pleaſed, therefore, to remember, that you having equipped a Fleet with great ſtilneſs, and quiet, and expedition, and early in the Year; not too big, leſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould ſuſpect you; nor too little, leſt you ſhould meet with an unexpected Repulſe in your intended Action: Sir <hi>Robert Holmes</hi> is made choice of as a Commander; you know he had given you experience of his Pyracies in the Years 1661, 1662, 1663, 1664. for he commenced the firſt Hoſtility againſt the <hi>Dutch;</hi> and in the ſame War he had ſignalized himſelf by burning the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships at <hi>Schelling,</hi> which the <hi>Dutch</hi> revenged upon us at <hi>Chatham;</hi> he therefore was the man appointed to commit this Intended Pyracy upon the <hi>Dutch Smyrna</hi> Fleet: You judging him a Perſon of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, Experience, and Courage, and every way capable of accompliſhing ſuch a villanous Enterprize, or of any black deviliſh Deſign of a higher nature. Sir <hi>Robert</hi> being thus appointed Commander in Chief of this deſigned Fleet, ſails away, and upon the 14th of <hi>March,</hi> 1672. as they ſailed on to the number of 72 Ships, whereof ſix were Convoys, near our Coaſt, he fell in upon them with his accuſtomed Bravery, and could not have failed of giving a very good account of them, would he but have joined Sir <hi>Edward Spragg</hi>'s aſſiſtance to his own Conduct; for Sir <hi>Edward</hi> was in ſight of them at the ſame time with another Squadron, and Captain <hi>Legg</hi> making ſail totward him to acquaint him with the Deſign, till called back by a Gun from his Admiral, of which ſeveral Perſons have their Conjectures; poſſibly Sir <hi>Robert Holmes,</hi> conſidering that Sir <hi>Edward</hi> had ſailed all along in conſort with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and did but now return from bringing the Pirates of <hi>Algiers</hi> to reaſon, thought him not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to engage in this Enterprize before he underſtood it better. But ſome have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that it proceeded partly from that jealouſie of admitting a ſhare of Honour and Profit in this Piracy, and partly out of too ſtrict a regard to preſerve his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſecret, but two of a Trade could not agree; and by this means the whole Affair miſcarried; and through the Bravery of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant-men, and their little Convoy, Sir <hi>Robert</hi> was forced to quit the Enterprize; and all that was got by this piece of Piracy never anſwered the great damage his Fleet and Seamen ſuſtained: When the News arrived of Sir <hi>Robert</hi>'s Fate, I well remember with what a ſad Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the Conſpirators walked about St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park, and <hi>Whitehall;</hi> you your ſelf was much out of humour at the Defeat. Your Confeſſor <hi>Beddingfield</hi> told me, <hi>That that Defeat was of ſuch ill conſequence to their Deſign, that it had almoſt broke all their Meaſures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Notwithſtanding all this, a War the Conſpirators were reſolved upon: And if, Sir, you will give me leave to deſcend to the bottom of your Helliſh Conſpiracy, and that was that of Religon for ſo Pious and ſo Juſt an Action, in which, Sir, you imployed Sir <hi>Robert Holmes,</hi> could not be better accompanied than by a Declaration of Liberty of Conſcience; you doubting that he could not find that admirable Commodity in the Hole of an <hi>Amſterdam</hi> Flyboat; therefore while he was trying his Fortune in Battel with the <hi>Smyrna</hi> Merchant-men on the 13th and 14th of <hi>March,</hi> 1672. the Indulgence was printing off with all haſte, and was publiſhed on the Fifteenth as a more proper means than Faſting and Prayer, to obtain a Bleſſing from Heaven upon his Enterprize, and upon a wicked War that was to ſecond it; upon which you may remember, that the King, your Brother, at your perſuaſion, and the Counſels of your Conſpirators, took upon him the Diſpenſing Power; juſt as you did when you uſurped the Throne; for by this Indulgence all the Penal Laws againſt the Papiſts, for which former Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56278:35"/>
had given ſo many Supplies to the Crown; and againſt Nonconformiſts, for which the Pentionary Parliament had paid more largely, were at one inſtant ſuſpended in order to cheat the whole Nation at once of all their Religion which they had ſo dearly purchaſed.</p>
            <p>But you, and your Conſpirators, may ſay, How was Liberty of Conſcience to get Money? You well remember, Sir, that the Popiſh Party were ſo well affected to this Point of ſuſpending the Penal Laws and Statutes that were againſt them; and that the King your Brother, and your ſelf, making ſuch ſolemn Proteſtations to the Gentlemen, and Noblemen, and the Monks, and the Dominicans, that this Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence was but a ſtep to the eſtabliſhing the Catholick Religion: That ſeveral Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemens Eſtates were ſo impaired in contributing to this wicked War, that they have not recovered the ſame to this day: The Monks at the <hi>Savoy</hi> were ſo undone, that they could ſcarce hold up their heads: And the Dominicans having parted with their All, were forced to fly for the Debts they had contracted in that Juncture of Affair: But the whole amounted to ſo little, that it did turn to little account; for the whole you got, and paid into the Conſpirators Bank, amounted to no more than 356000 <hi>l.</hi> As for the Proteſtant Diſſenters, tho they made uſe of the Liberty you procured for them, yet they parted with no Money; they remembring what a Cheat was ſo lately put upon the Nation in the buſineſs of the ſhutting up the Exchequer: And conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Indulgence it ſelf was but an Arbitrary Act in the King your Brother, and would never paſs for currant Law when ever a Parliament ſhould meet; your Jeſuits they pleaded that they had no Caſh, they having let great Sums upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of ſeveral Eſtates belonging to the Noblemen and Gentlemen that were of the Catholick Church: And beſides all this, they had met with a loſs from one that had lately fallen from them; ſo that then they had not ready Money to part with, all this Project did not anſwer your Expectation. Tho your Conſpirators did aſſure you, If it were done, it would bring a Million into your Conſpirators Bank; but ſuch a Sum as it was, it hath cauſed many a Popiſh Gentleman to ſing <hi>Lachrymae,</hi> till your Acceſſion to the Crown; and as a Reward and Plaiſter, they were put into Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both Civil and Military; which Imployments never let them ſee the fortieth part of the Intereſt of their Money, the Principal being totally loſt.</p>
            <p>A War being proclaimed, you muſt now carry it on: What did you do with the ſmall Stock you had? you equip out a Fleet. The <hi>French</hi> King ſeeing you, and your Conſpirators, ingaged beyond retreat, comes into the War, according to agreement, and proclaims War againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> not in ſo ſneaking a manner as you did; for he would aſſign no Cauſe; but ſaid, <hi>It was for his glory, and that ſuch was his pleaſure.</hi> But by his Ambaſſador to the Pope, he gave the Pope the true Cauſe; which you durſt not for your Ears give to the Pope, or any body elſe; tho that was the Deſign of King <hi>Charles,</hi> and your ſelf: His Ambaſſador ſaid, <hi>That his Maſter had not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the War againſt the</hi> Hollander <hi>in conjunction with the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>but for the extirpating of Hereſie:</hi> And the <hi>French</hi> King to the Emperor of <hi>Germany</hi> ſaith, <hi>The</hi> Hollanders <hi>were a People that had forſaken God, and were Hereticks; and that all Chriſtian Princes ought to aſſociate together for their Extirpation: That it was a War of Religion, in order to propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the Catholick Faith.</hi> You know, that your Brother's, the <hi>French</hi> King's, and your Intereſt and Religion, were the ſame; And what other Deſign then could you have in that wicked War, but to advance the Religion of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Church, and Power of <hi>France</hi> both at home and abroad? and that the Declaration of Indulgence was but a ſtep
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56278:36"/>
towards the ſetting up the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, according to the Agreement that was made with Madam, your Siſter, at the Interview in <hi>June</hi> 1670. and by that means you met with that Contribution from the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Party to carry on this War of Religion againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who you judged to be Hereticks.</p>
            <p>Give me leave, Sir, to make a little digreſſion: You know that the late Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who was then in the Conſpiracy with you, was ſent into <hi>France</hi> to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row 40 Sail of <hi>French</hi> Ships; and by agreement our King was to Man them. The <hi>French</hi> King judged that too great a Point to be gained by King <hi>Charles</hi> upon him, and wheedles with the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and offers him 100000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling to conſent that he ſhould Man the Fleet; againſt which the Duke urged it was againſt the Agreement the King his Maſter had made with him the <hi>French</hi> King, and ſo would not accept the 100000 <hi>l.</hi> withal, telling the <hi>French</hi> King, <hi>That if he would let us be</hi> Neptune <hi>at Sea, he ſhould be</hi> Jove <hi>by Land:</hi> The <hi>French</hi> King ſeemed contented, and ſo the Diſcourſe ended. But the <hi>French</hi> King deals then with the Lord <hi>Arlington,</hi> and gives him 60000 <hi>l.</hi> and <hi>Arlington</hi> prevailed, Sir, with you to preſs the King, your Brother, not to inſiſt upon Manning the <hi>French</hi> Fleet with <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for that it would be leſs charge to him, if the <hi>French</hi> King did Man the Fleet himſelf; and withal, ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the King, That they were but low, and they ſhould have occaſion enough for Money otherwiſe: So <hi>Arlington</hi> got by the Bargain his 60000 <hi>l.</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King the advantage of ſetting out his own Fleet.</p>
            <p>Well, Sir, you remember the <hi>French</hi> Fleet was ſet out, and joined the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet was commanded by your ſelf, and the <hi>French</hi> Fleet by Monſieur <hi>d' Eſtree;</hi> and upon the 28th of <hi>May,</hi> 1672. you were attacked in <hi>Soul-Bay</hi> by <hi>De Ruyter,</hi> who commanded the <hi>Dutch</hi> with a great deal of Bravery, and the Attack was made with great advantage on the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſide; you did what you could to have beaten the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Admiral did what he was ſent for, and that was to look on till you both were well worried; Vice-Admiral <hi>Montague</hi> was ſacrificed, and your Fleet ſo damnably mangled, that a man would have thought you had met with another <hi>Smyrna</hi> Fleet; but our Bells did ring for joy, but God know there was no occaſion on your ſide to boaſt of a Victory; but you may ſee what it is to be in ill Company; and, I think, they ſerved the <hi>Dutch</hi> the ſame Trick, when they joined with them in the Year 1666. a remarkable Year, you know for what; but of that in its proper place.</p>
            <p>What is next? You may be will not own you were beaten by the <hi>Dutch;</hi> but it is plain, that if you had a Victory, it was not worth the name of one; but we have no more fighting under your Command. How fared it with your Brother of <hi>France?</hi> truly, very well; for the reſt of the Year paſſed with great ſucceſs to the <hi>French,</hi> but none to the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> What ſhall we do now? What did you begin that War upon Hopes, yes, and great hopes too; the <hi>French</hi> King's ſupplying us towards the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of it on, and taking the <hi>Smyrna</hi> Fleet, and a multitude of <hi>Dutch</hi> Prizes; but <hi>Prob Dolor!</hi> all theſe Hopes vaniſhed, and the Revenue exhauſted, and the Exchequer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money ſpent; then, Sir, you were put to your laſt ſhifts. Since Liberty of Conſcience turned to ſo little account; well, you reſolved once more to permit your Brother's Calling his Parliament to ſet down on the 4th of <hi>February,</hi> 1672/3. the very day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, for God knows you were ſo diſappointed, that I wonder you were able to ſet out a Fleet that Year.</p>
            <p n="5">5. You come to your laſt Project for the carrying on the War, and that is the Parliament; and ſo by the good leave of your <hi>Banditti,</hi> they do ſet down; but that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56278:36"/>
which is the greateſt aſtoniſhment to me, that they could look a Parliament in the face, after they had adviſed and compleated ſo many Rogueries in an interval of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and how you your ſelf could ſit with eaſe in the Houſe of Peers, whereas you could not but be conſcious to your ſelf of abetting and joining in with theſe theſe Rogues in their Villany: Well then, What ſaid your Conſpirators to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament? truly they communicated the War to them, and the Cauſes of the War; the Neceſſity of the War, and the Danger of the War, if not ſupplied; but not a word of your hopes of never wanting them any more; not a word of the Deſign of Propogating the Catholick Cauſe; you mentioned the Medals, and Pictures, and the Flag, but the Devil a word of the Northern Hereſy, and the reducing the <hi>States-General</hi> to the Popiſh Religion. Truly, Sir, this Houſe of Commons took pity upon you, and according to their never failing Loyalty to the Crown, knowing that a good Gratuity would appear to themſelves, put you off with the ſmall Pittance of 1250000 <hi>l.</hi> tho thoſe Penſioners would waſh their hands of the War; and therefore would not give this Money for the carrying a War againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but for the <hi>King's Extraordinary Occaſions.</hi> But was this all they did? no, it was not all; there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe done that did ſome what allay the growing Greatneſs of you, and your Conſpirators; for tho they were to be ſupplied for their private Occaſions out of the 1250000 <hi>l.</hi> they had given, yet they were ſenſible that the Nation began to ſmoak the true Cauſes of this wicked War, and the End for which it was undertaken. There was an Act prepared before the Money-Bill was paſſed, by which your Popiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators were obliged to paſs through a new State-Purgatory, or to be uncabable of any Publick Imployment. I remember, when I was abroad, what Curſes were laid upon the Parliament for that ſcurvy Bill, and upon the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> who, tho then Lord Chancellor, yet engaged ſo far in that Act, and in defence of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, that in due time it coſt him his Place; which notwithſtanding the Popiſh Parties bitter Curſes, he won a fair Reputation, and became, to their great grief, a zealous Aſſertor of the Rights of the People of <hi>England.</hi> Was this all? No, your firſt ſtep to the Eſtabliſhment of Popery (the Indulgence I mean) was called in queſtion; and tho the Popiſh Party had contributed more than it was worth for the carrying on of the War, the King was pleaſed to cancel it, and promiſed that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver would do ſo any more, and paſſed the Teſt-Bill: Did he ſo? Had he not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed the Princeſs, your Siſter, that he would reſtore the Roman Catholick Religion, and that he would begin firſt in <hi>Ireland;</hi> in order to which, you know the Lord <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts</hi> was removed, and another that was baſe enough to do ſuch a Jobb, was ſent in his room; and you, in your Brother's Name, engaged the ſame to your Popiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributors, and he engaged in his own name the like. It is ſcarce poſſible to believe it; how could he anſwer this to <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King? For it was his Agreement with him, to have the ſame Government, and the ſame Religion; truly he could not tell how to help it, the Sons of <hi>Zerviah</hi> were too many for him.</p>
            <p>And 1250000 <hi>l.</hi> was not to be loſt for want of a compliance with the Parliament; and to you the King promiſed that he would make it up to the Roman Catholicks another way; but how, and when, I could never learn: But, Sir, was it not hard, that they ſhould be incapable of Offices and Employments, ſince they had purchaſed them at ſo dear a rate, but theſe Arguments prevailed not; ſo the Bills were paſſed, and the Parliament was diſmiſſed till the 27th of <hi>October,</hi> 1673. and good reaſon there was for their diſmiſſion, for their ſitting was grown very uneaſy to your Popiſh Conſpirators.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:56278:37"/>
But, Sir, we could not but laugh in our Sleeves to ſee ſome of the Conſpirators take up the Croſs, and quit their Imployments; as the Lord <hi>Clifford,</hi> the Lord <hi>Bellaſis,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Strickland,</hi> and others, who had long appeared zealous Sons of our Church, yet diſcovered to be of the Synagogue of <hi>Rome,</hi> as ſoon as the Teſt or Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Bill paſſed; and truly, Sir, we were not ſorry when you appeared to be of the ſame Complexion with thoſe other Conſpirators; tho at the ſame time, I muſt tell you, That your going off did aſtoniſh many men, there being no Record in Hiſtory of any Prince that changed his Religion in your Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>But, did your Conſpirators ſtand ſtill, and put up the Sword that was drawn againſt the <hi>Dutch?</hi> No, they had got 1250000 <hi>l.</hi> therefore you and they ſtrove with all imaginable ſtrength to regain by the War that part of the Curſed Deſign that was loſt by Parliament, tho ſome of you forſook your Places, rather than your Conſciences; yet, Sir, you never wanted ſome double-dy'd Sons of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in your Places, upon the ſame Terms your Popiſh Conſpirators held them; ſo that they were but your Conſpirators Deputies, who followed the ſame Councels, and carried on the ſame Deſign, for this Year was a fruitful Year of Engagements with the <hi>Dutch;</hi> the <hi>French</hi> carries all before him by Land; but we got nothing from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but maimed Ships, and broken Bones; we had indeed changed our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, but our Succeſs was the ſame: For you remember with whom we were in Conjunction, we may thank our ſelves for keeping ſuch ill Company: So that in a word, I may ſay thoſe Heretick Dogs, as they were termed by the Great <hi>Lewis,</hi> were too many for our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Popiſh Conſpirators.</p>
            <p>What then? Did we nothing by land? had we not an Army at <hi>Black-Heath,</hi> and General <hi>Schomberg</hi> at the head of them; Yes, we had, but that good Gentleman, when he ſaw the Army, and underſtood that they were not an Army againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but were deſigned againſt <hi>London,</hi> he fairly quitted his Poſt, and the Kingdom at the ſame time, as being aſhamed of your Conſpirators Intentions in the raiſing that Army: He being a <hi>French-man,</hi> you imagined he would join with you in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the <hi>French</hi> mode of Government; and your <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſt that was Major-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, was to have brought in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Religion; the latter would have been true to the uttermoſt of his power, and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Diſcretion; but the former was a Proteſtant and ſo waſhed his hands of the buſineſs.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, that the <hi>French</hi> were on our ſide; yes, Sir, they were; but it is as plain as the Sun ſhining at Noon-day, that the <hi>French</hi> in this ſecond War againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> intended nothing leſs than really to aſſiſt us, for he was no Changeling; for he had practiſed the ſame Art at Sea, in the firſt War the Conſpirators had againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> when he was in league with them, for his Navy never did them any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, for his buſineſs was only to ſee us batter one another; and it's well known, that when he pretended to be on our ſide, and to aſſiſt us, they then only took an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ſound our Seas, to ſpy our Ports, and to learn our Building, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate our way of Fight, to conſume our Navy, and preſerve his own to increaſe his own Commerce; and to order all ſo, that the two great Naval Powers of <hi>Europe</hi> being cruſhed together, that he might remain Prince and Lord of the Ocean; and by conſequence, Maſter of all the Iſles, and the <hi>Continent</hi> into the bargain: To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you, and your <hi>Banditti,</hi> furniſhed him with all poſſible Opportunities, as I ſhall by and by relate; as well to put you in mind of what you, and the reſt of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, did do, as to inform thoſe of your Party here that are ſtill ignorant of the Tranſactions of thoſe Times.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:56278:37"/>
Notwithſtanding that we were always worſted by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> yet they having a regard to the preſervation of our Religion and Liberties; which you had agreed to part withal to the <hi>French</hi> Court, made ſtrong Applications for a Peace; and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators for a Supply to carry on the War; and all Endeavours were by you, and your Friends, uſed to render the <hi>Dutch</hi> odious to the Parliament; witneſs the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities that were uſed, and great Aſſurances given: In a word, nothing but the Voice of War was in their Mouths. But you know that there was an unhappy Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident fell out, which I ſhall ſhow you in its proper place, that made the King put off the Parliament that ſat down the 27th of <hi>October,</hi> till the 7th of <hi>January</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and in the mean time, what Artifices your Accomplices uſed for to prepare the Parliament to have an ill Opinion of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> you may ſee in the Speech made by that Villain of a Keeper, who was your Tool to all intents and purpoſes; you may remember how he repreſented the <hi>Dutch,</hi> how averſe they were to Peace and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and how uncivil and indirect in their Overtures of Treaty with His Majeſty; and therefore a demand was made of a proportionable and ſpeedy Supply: But the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who ſound themſelves abuſed and obſtructed, and hitherto in a manner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from all manner of Application; and whatever means they had uſed, was ſtill miſinterpreted and ill repreſented, they were ſo wiſe and induſtrious, as by this time to have undeceived moſt of the Members of Parliament; therefore the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were for a Peace to be made with the <hi>Dutch;</hi> and in order thereunto, would not part with one Penny judging that to be the beſt means for a Peace to follow; and began to call ſome of your Rogues to an account, that had been principal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers of that moſt ungodly War; this was an excellent, but a new way of nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating a Peace with the <hi>States-General.</hi> I well remember, that ſome of your Friends began to look blew upon the buſineſs, looking every day to be called to an account for their Conſpiracy againſt our Laws, Liberties, and Religion, in the contriving and carrying on this War, as aforeſaid: (By this means, Sir, but full againſt your will) I can tell how it grieved your Soul, to ſee the general bent of the whole Nation to be againſt the War, eſpecially becauſe the <hi>French</hi> were engaged in it: In a word, The Houſe of Commons adviſed your Brother to a Juſt and an Honourable Peace with the <hi>States-General,</hi> which the King put off till it could be no longer oppoſed; then a Peace was concluded with the <hi>Dutch;</hi> and when that was done, the Commons ſtill had an evil Eye upon the Conſpirators, and got eight New Regiments to be disband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that as the Exchequer had been ſhut up, <hi>London</hi> might not be plundred, and the Citizens might not be Dragooned out of their Eſtates, Liberties, and Religion, all at once. Upon this Peace being concluded with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> oh, what complaining Letters did you ſend to your Friends at St. <hi>Omers!</hi> charging the King, your Brother, with the greateſt breach of Promiſes and Oaths made to Madam, the Princeſs; and alſo Letters were ſent to <hi>Doway,</hi> to the Monks there, yet aſſuring them you would never leave the Cauſe ſo; for you ſtill hoped that his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty would do the work, and ruin the <hi>Dutch States,</hi> that they might not be a Neſt for Rebels and Hereticks:</p>
            <p>I was ſaying juſt now, How could King <hi>Charles</hi> anſwer the Cancelling the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Indulgence, and the paſſing the Teſt-Bill, to <hi>Lewis</hi> his great Ally? But now, Sir, I much more wonder, how he could anſwer to that King, his Concluding a Peace with the <hi>States-General</hi> of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces?</hi> for this ſeemed to me, and many others, the greateſt Riddle how this would ſtand with the Holy League that he had made
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56278:38"/>
with that King to root out Hereſy, and to ſet up Popery? for could we have but ruined the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the work had been done to all intents and purpoſes.</p>
            <p>Your Party well knew, that <hi>Charles,</hi> your ſelf, and the then Lords of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly, fell under the diſpleaſure of the <hi>French</hi> King by conſent; and ſince you could not humble the <hi>Dutch,</hi> how willingly you condeſcended that the High and Mighty Monarch of <hi>France</hi> ſhould have the humbling of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation; for by your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Procurement it was agreed, That he ſhould let looſe his Privateers among our Merchant-men; ſo that from that time there was no ſecurity of Commerce and Navigation, notwithſtanding the publick Amity that was between the two Crowns; but at Sea they murthered, plundered, made Prize, and confiſcated thoſe they met with; their Pyrats laid before the Mouths of our Rivers, hovered all along upon our Coaſts, took our Ships in the very Ports; inſomuch, that we in a manner were blockt up by Water; and if any made application at his Sovereign Port for Juſtice, they were inſolently baffled, if not cruelly beaten: This you know, and the Nation well knew, that <hi>Charles,</hi> your ſelf, and the Admiralty, were Accomplices in this matter, and that it did turn to a good account to the Conſpirators, as can be made appear even, Sir, to your face at St. <hi>Germains:</hi> And this way of uſing the Nation continued till the latter end of the Year 1676. even from our concluding the Peace with the <hi>States-General</hi> of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was this all? No, this way of Pyrating was only a mark of his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty's Diſpleaſure. It was no reparation for our good King <hi>Charles</hi>'s not keeping his word with him; therefore all diligence was uſed to ſupply him with Recruits, and thoſe who would go voluntarily over, were incouraged; others that would not, were preſſed, impriſoned, and carried over by main force, even as the Parliament here was ready to ſet down, notwithſtanding all the former frequent Applications to the contrary: Nay, yet further, How did you empty all the Magazines of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to furniſh the <hi>French</hi> with all ſorts of Ammunition? of which, Sir, a particular Account was taken, and can be given, if demanded.</p>
            <p>It is, Sir, well known, that King <hi>Charles</hi> having broken the Tripple League, and made a War upon the <hi>Dutch</hi> without Cauſe, and had made Peace with them; he would never enter into a League Offenſive and Defenſive with them; yet he could make one with the <hi>French,</hi> tho he had taken the Kingdom's Money to enter into an actual War: Nay, that Conſpirator <hi>Conventry,</hi> had the League Offenſive and Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, made with the <hi>French</hi> King, in his Pocket, when the Houſe of Commons voted the Money for an actual War with <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be, Sir, you may ſay that King <hi>Charles</hi> did make an Alliance with <hi>Holland;</hi> and the Articles of the League were, on <hi>April</hi> 30. 1678. laid before the Houſe by the King's eſpecial direction: It may be ſo; But will your Party call that a League Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive and Defenſive, fit for a Parliament of <hi>England</hi> to agree to? No; for ſee how the Houſe reſented that Sham-League; and to this end obſerve their Vote, <hi>May</hi> the 4th, 1678. Reſolved, <hi>That the League Offenſive and Defenſive with the</hi> States-General <hi>of the</hi> United Provinces, <hi>with the Articles relating thereunto, are not purſuant to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes of this Houſe, nor conſiſtent with the Good and Safety of the Kingdom.</hi> That was one Reſolve. But there was a ſecond Reſolution of the Houſe upon the ſame day. Reſolved, <hi>That it is the Opinion of this Houſe, That His Majeſty be humbly adviſed and deſired forthwith to enter into the preſent Alliances and Confederations with the Emperor, the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>and with the</hi> States-General <hi>of the</hi> United Provinces, <hi>for the vigorous carrying on the War</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:56278:38"/>
               <hi>againſt the</hi> French <hi>King, and for the good and ſafety of His Majeſty's Kingdoms; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, That effectual Endeavours be uſed for continuing the</hi> States-General <hi>in the preſent Confederation; And that it be agreed by all Parties Confederate, to prohibit all Trade between their Subjects, and Countries, and</hi> France, <hi>and all other Dominions of the</hi> French <hi>King. And that no Commodities of</hi> France, <hi>or of the Dominions of the</hi> French <hi>King, be imported into their Countries from any place whatſoever: And alſo that all endeavours be uſed to invite all other Princes and States into the ſaid Confederation; and that no Truce or Peace be made, or agreed to, with the</hi> French <hi>King, by His Majeſty, or any of the Confederates, without the general Conſent of all the Confederates had firſt therein.</hi> Both which Reſolves were ſent to His Majeſty by the Members of Parliament that were of the Privy Council; and what a meſſage they receive on the 6th of <hi>May</hi> following, ſhews plainly his unwillingneſs to enter into League with the Confederates againſt <hi>France:</hi> And, Sir, you know the Reaſon why, Becauſe the Intereſt and Religion of <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, was the Intereſt and Religion of the King your Brother, and your ſelf, and Conſpirators.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, that which teſtifies your Brother's Obſtinacy, is refuſing to enter into ſuch a League Offenſive and Defenſive with the <hi>States-General</hi> of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> &amp;c. For notwithſtanding the Treaty of Peace with the <hi>States General,</hi> had not you, and your Conſpirators, furniſhed the <hi>French</hi> King with Men and Arms, and Ammunition, againſt the very Tenure and Intent of the ſaid Treaty? Therefore the Lords and Commons join in an Addreſs on the 10th of <hi>November,</hi> 1675. in which they earneſtly preſſed the King, your Brother, to call home his Subjects from the Service of the <hi>French</hi> King; but inſtead of that, more were ſent, and many of them by force, or fraud, call to mind the Addreſs made by the Houſe of Commons, on <hi>May</hi> 20, 1675. where great Complaints were made by the Houſe, of the Conſpirators ſupplying the <hi>French</hi> King with Men, not a few, but conſiderable numbers, to the great diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Confederates engaged in the Common Cauſe againſt that proud Monſter of Mankind. So the Vote of <hi>May</hi> 23, 1677. Reſolved, <hi>That an humble Addreſs be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to His Majeſty, That he would be pleaſed to enter into a League Offenſive and Defenſive with the</hi> States-General <hi>of the</hi> United Provinces; <hi>and to make ſuch other Alliances with ſuch other Confederates as His Majeſty ſhall think fit, againſt the Growth and Power of the</hi> French <hi>King, and preſervation of the</hi> Netherlands. And what was done upon all theſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes? truly, very little; but up ſtarts a League made with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that was not worth one Farthing; and how that Sham-League was kept, we all very well remember.</p>
            <p>But as a further proof of your Brother's Being unwilling to enter into any firm and hearty League with the Confederates engaged againſt the <hi>French</hi> King, remember this; Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> through yours, and the Power the reſt of the Conſpirators had over him, he could never be brought to enter into, and be engaged in an actual War with <hi>France,</hi> notwitſtanding all the humble Applications made to him by Parliaments; nay, tho he paſſed a Bill to enter into a War with <hi>France,</hi> and had the benevolence given in that Bill in order to the ſame, yet a firm League was made with <hi>France,</hi> the Intereſt and Religion of the <hi>French,</hi> King and the King, your Brother, and your ſelf, being all one.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place be pleaſed, Sir, to remember, that the Parliament that was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed to the Third of <hi>December,</hi> 1677. and then put off till the Fifteenth of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> 1677/78; but that day being come, both Houſes met, but by a Meſſage to the Houſe of Commons they are ordered to adjourn till the Twenty eighth, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended reaſon the then King gave (or rather you, and your Conſpirators) that his Majeſty had matters of great Importance in order to the ſatisfaction of their Addreſſes
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56278:39"/>
for the Preſervation of <hi>Flanders;</hi> but it ſo fell out, that things were not then ſo ripe, as in a few days they would be; therefore it was his Majeſties Royal Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that the Houſe do immediately Adjourn till the Twenty eighth of the ſame Month.</p>
            <p>The Meſſage was very Grateful to the Houſe of Commons, and to many others, who underſtood not the Conſpiracy, for the deſign was clear another thing than what they had conceived. The day of their meeting comes, and they are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with a Speech full of good Words, yet he Reprimands them for their diſtruſt; and to ſhew them how they were miſtaken, they are told what a great care the King had taken of the Proteſtant Religion: And in order thereunto, he had concluded a Match with the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> to the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> (but you know, Sir, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it was full ſore againſt his and your Wills) a Prince Profeſſing the ſame Religion w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> us (which by King <hi>Charles</hi>'s good leave) was a great miſtake; for I dare ſay that the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> now our King, never Receiv'd the Sacrament from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in all his days, which to my certain knowledge King <hi>Charles</hi> did, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Receiv'd it from the hands of a Biſhop of the Church of <hi>England</hi> the ſelf-ſame day. But to go on with his Speech, he told them that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was a Prince ingaged in Arms to Defend the Common Cauſe of <hi>Chridendom;</hi> and ſo he goes on and talks of Alliances, and forgets not to call for a freſh ſupply, that he might carry on his Alliances made, and to be made. Well, Sir, What was the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of this Moſt Gracious Speech? I remember that the Houſe in return made an humble but a ſharp Addreſs, and the Speech was not anſwered with Thanks in General, but only in Particular, relating to the King's care he had of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion; which Addreſs was Concluded on <hi>January 31ſt.</hi> following.</p>
            <p>In that Addreſs they promiſe the King Supplies, provided he would enter into an actual War with <hi>France,</hi> and join in with the Confederates, and Exclaim againſt the growing Greatneſs of the <hi>French</hi> King; and that if it muſt be Peace, that they would have the <hi>French</hi> King left in no better condition than he was upon the Concluſion of the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Treaty.</p>
            <p>I remember when this Addreſs was made, I was at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> but we had news from <hi>Coleman</hi> how you reſented it; nay, Sir, it's well known that the Addreſs ſtuck terribly in your ſtomach, as well as the Match between the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> (our Late Gracious Queen) by which, Sir, you could not but eaſily perceive that the Houſe of Commons had got ſome ſcent of the Damnable Plot that was carrying on againſt our Religion, Laws, and Liberty; and your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand-dealing with <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Intereſt. But that men might not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand you too well, your Agents were buſy both in City and Countrey to n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>iſh a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Alliances with the Confederates, and a War with <hi>France;</hi> and ſo big they preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be of the War with <hi>France,</hi> that they avowed the certainty of it both in words and in Print; all this I ſay was to keep the Nation in horrid Ignorance: To this end, Sir, you hired a Tool that had pawned his Soul for Bread, to write againſt the <hi>French</hi> King; but all was not gold that gliſtered, there was no Money like to come, becauſe that the Houſe was reſolved to be ſatisfied that the Alliances were made, and the War proclaimed: This, Sir, you, and your Party, looked upon as a great hardſhip put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King, and that the Houſe of Commons took too much upon them; but your Rogues made uſe of this Addreſs to be a poor Cripple to beg Money even from <hi>France</hi> it ſelf; you know who undertook in that Affair to get Money from <hi>France</hi> upon the ſtrength of that Addreſs, and was in a fair way of ſucceeding, had not ſomething hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56278:39"/>
between the Cup and the Lip: In a word; Nothing but War with <hi>France</hi> is talked of; the <hi>French</hi> is content it ſhould be a Bill paſſed for a War, and Money was given; the <hi>French</hi> King concurred with you in it; a Law paſſes againſt the Importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>French</hi> Goods, he wills that too; for you had ſo ordered the matter, that notwithſtanding that Act, by the diligent care of the Officers of the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe,</hi> there was more <hi>French</hi> Goods brought into the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe</hi> than before.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, you were not idle all this time; for while the People of <hi>England</hi> were talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of War and Alliances, you, and your Conſpirators, were buſie both at home and abroad; oh, the multitude of Meſſages that were ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>France!</hi> and you know what Advice was given you; that upon the account of the pretended War, you ſhould raiſe Forces; for the Prieſts doubted not, through the aſſiſtance of the Saints, the work would be done; you raiſed Forces, and got Money, tho for other ends than the Parliament gave it; Was this, Sir, to carry on the War, or to go on in making of Alliances? you know it was that Popery, and the <hi>French</hi> Government might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced both at one and the ſame time; ſo that, Sir, I have juſtified that head, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs of King <hi>Charles</hi>'s entring into, and keeping League with thoſe who would uphold and maintain the Proteſtant Religion; but choſe rather to make Alliances with <hi>France,</hi> yea and keep them too, with a King that had a mighty mind to deſtroy it.</p>
            <p>11. I come to the laſt Paſſage that I propoſed in the beginning of this Memento to treat about, and that is this; That as long as King <hi>Charles</hi> lived, what a diſmal and difficult task had this Nation to ſuppreſs you, and your wicked Popiſh, and Popiſhly affected Accomplices? and that when he died, you were like to be his Succeſſor; and therefore the Commons took this into ſerious conſideration; and upon the whole, that the ſtate of Religion was deſperate; and that the Popiſh Conſpirators would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be advanced, and that there would be nothing leſs than the Nation to all intents and purpoſes ruined; therefore, I pray, Sir, remember the Vote paſſed, <hi>Ap.</hi> 27.1679.</p>
            <p>Reſolved, <hi>Nemine Contradicente, That the Duke of</hi> York <hi>being a Papiſt, and the hopes of his coming to the Crown ſuch, hath given the greateſt incouragement to the preſent Conſpiracy and deſigns of the Papiſts againſt the King, and the Proteſtant Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, This Vote would have ground and beaten an ordinary Subject to Powder, but it had not that effect upon you, and your Party; your Party was ſo prevalent at that time, your Popiſh Party I mean, that you, and your Conſpirators threw off all theſe Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties with ſcorn and impudence enough; for it is plain enough, that the Popiſh Party had ſuch an influence upon King <hi>Charles,</hi> as to favour them, notwithſtanding the notoriety of thoſe Crimes both they and you ſtood charged withal: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Popiſh Party had a great intereſt at Court upon the pretence of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Loyalty in the time of the Civil War between <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: And again, ſome few of them were inſtrumental in the eſcape of his Son <hi>Charles</hi> the Second from <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and the ſeeming readineſs that was in that Party for the Reſtoration of the ſaid <hi>Charles</hi> the Second in the Year 1660. this gave them not only a ſhare of peace and Quiet under <hi>Charles</hi>'s Government, but procured from him a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degree of reſpect unto them; by this means they had a very great advantage of carrying on their Deſigns againſt the Intereſt of the Nation, and Peace of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and this was the Argument, Sir, that you uſed for that part of your <hi>Banditti,</hi> in order to join your Forces and ſtrengthen your Party. Give me leave, Sir, to obſerve to you, how wicked a thing it was in you to embolden ſuch a party of Rogues to ruin the Nation; you uſed to ſay they were always loyal, and therefore how many times did you
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56278:40"/>
procure great Indulgences from the Government, againſt the expreſs Letter of the Law, for them, while the rigor of the Law was let looſe upon other Diſſenters, who yet continued more quiet and loyal under their Preſſures and Provocations, than thoſe under Favours and Careſſes; and did not the King, your Brother, hazard the Hearts and Affections of his beſt Subjects, and much of Royal Honour (if ever he had any) in appearing for his Indulgence of <hi>March</hi> 15. 1671/2 with fruſtration, to engage, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, theſe everlaſting holy Cutthroats; but where was the Loyalty of theſe your Popiſh Conſpirators? For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Was it not at their inſtigation (when they were in a Conſpiracy againſt the Peace of this Nation with that Arch-Traytor <hi>Laud,</hi> that was ſometime Archbiſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury)</hi> that the Uniformity of Service that was in <hi>England,</hi> was againſt all Law, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Conſcience, preſſed upon the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which occaſioned that breach with that Nation, that was not without great difficulty, and vaſt expence, made up to the diſhonour of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation. You cannot but remember, you have been informed who were the Prime Sticklers upon the occaſion of that Service-book, and other ſtrange Impoſitions laid upon that people to foment the War between the two Kingdoms. For in your Letter to <hi>Aſhby,</hi> the Rector of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colledge at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> dated <hi>March</hi> 17, 1676/7. to ſupply you with a dozen of ſuch men as were uſed in <hi>Scotland</hi> in 1637, 1638, 1639. that would not ſtick at any thing to carry on the Catholick Cauſe; in which you ſaid, that his Majeſty of <hi>France,</hi> your Brother, and your ſelf, were ingaged, for you then did want them; and upon the receipt of your Letter the <hi>Scotch</hi> Colledge at <hi>Doway</hi> was conſulted, and 12 men were diſpatched over for <hi>England,</hi> for what Ends and Purpoſes you know well enough.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Point in hand; The Prieſts that were ſent into <hi>Scotland</hi> in the time of your Father, <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, you have been informed that they were ſent by Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> into that ancient Kingdom to enflame the Differences between the two Nations; and the Motives upon which that great Incendiary was ſo earneſt to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle a War in the Dominions of your Father, were ſufficiently underſtood by thoſe that lived, and were actually engaged in publick Negotiations, who have been ſo juſt as to leave them upon record to future Generations; and they were the very ſame Motives that you, and your Party, made the grounds for the ſubverſion of the Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government; theſe were your loyal Men that would have brought in a Religion upon us by a converſion of us with Blood, and a Baptiſm with fire; but the Good Lord, I hope, will keep the Land from the one, and this great City from the other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Your Conſpirators were men of undoubted Loyalty; and this <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> will believe, if you can make them; becauſe of their great zeal in commencing and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that never to be forgotten bloody Maſſacre in <hi>Ireland,</hi> wherein ſo many thouſand Proteſtants loſt their Lives, and were by your Hell-born Cut-throats baſely and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly murthered: Nay, as a teſtimony of their Loyalty, they renounced your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Authority, and the Authority of his Lord Lieutenant of that Kingdom, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the Royal Authority to themſelves, owing only a dependance upon the Pope, and his Nuncio; yet theſe men for that piece of barbarity, were by you, and your Brother, recommended to ſeveral Princes, as men that had ventured their Lives, and loſt their Eſtates, for promoting the Catholick Apoſtolick Religion in <hi>Ireland</hi> by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and expreſs Command of your Royal Father of bleſſed Memory; and many of them in their old age were, at your Brother's requeſt, and yours, made Prieſts to get Bread for that piece of Service.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:56278:40"/>
3. The Loyalty of your Conſpirators did highly appear in that acceſſion they had to the Death of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, they did contrive it; and this hath been made appear to their ſhame and diſgrace (if ever they were capable of any); that King was himſelf informed a little before he was executed, that the Jeſuits, at a general Meeting at <hi>Paris,</hi> in revenge for his condeſcending in the Treaty at the <hi>Iſle of Wight</hi> to paſs ſome Bills in prejudice of them, and the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, had unanimouſly reſolved by the Power, and Intereſt, and Influence, that they had in, and upon the Army, to bring him to Juſtice, and get him executed; and accordingly, when the ſtroke was given, both one that was a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſt and Confeſſor, brandiſhed his Sword, and proclaimed that now their greateſt Enemy was cut off, and deſtroyed. I ſuppoſe, Sir, you, and your Party, will be convinced, if you obſerve a Paſſage from one that knew thoſe Tranſanctions, and ſee what he ſaith in his Letter to a Reverend Divine of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> it bears date, <hi>Aug.</hi> 9.1673. <hi>This I may ſafely ſay, and will do it confidently, That many Arguments did create a violent ſuſpicion, very near con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Evidences, that the Irreligion of the Papiſts was chiefly the occaſion of the murther of that Prince; the odium whereof they would file to the Account of the Proteſtant Religion.</hi> However, Sir, your Popiſh Conſpirators having not only eſcaped the legal Arraignments upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but having ſince the Reſtoration of K. <hi>Charles</hi> the IId, been eſteemed by your ſelf, and ſome other pretended Friends of that King, they have thereupon arrived at more reſpect; and to carry on your damnable Deſigns, they have enjoyed more peace in their Perſons and Eſtates, than they were in poſſeſſion of at any time ſince the Reformation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But how little they deſerved this Honour and Peace both in their Perſons and Eſtates, you may ſee in a fourth Particular; and that was in the Eſcape of the King, your Brother, from <hi>Worceſter,</hi> 1651. how did they above all men, endeavour to betray and ſacrifice that King unto the hands of his Enemies; And who was to pay the 1000 <hi>l.</hi> promiſed for his being diſcovered, and taken, but Father <hi>Joſeph Symmonds,</hi> and Father <hi>Carleton Compton,</hi> both Jeſuits; and whence that Money came, Sir, you well know, as did the Queen, your Mother; for you know, that your Mother, and your ſelf, was in a plot againſt his Life, that you might wear the Name and Title of a King, as being the more likely to perform what your Brother had ſo luſtily promiſed to the Popiſh Party. It is true, Sir, that one or two of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Perſuaſion, amongſt many loyal and faithful Proteſtants, both Male and Fem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le, might then have contributed to that King's Deliverance; but ſuch, Sir, have been by your ſelf, and Party, well chidden, reproached, and diſcountenanced, and called Fools, for this grain of Loyalty, more owing to their <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood, than <hi>Romiſh</hi> Principles.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Since my hand is in, give me leave to add a fifth Inſtance of their Loyalty to your Family. That Popiſh Lord is not unknown, nor yet forgotten, who brought a Petition to the late Protector, ſigned by about 500 Principal Papiſts in <hi>England,</hi> wherein they promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon condition of a Toleration of the Popiſh Religion here by a Law, their joint Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to abjure and exclude the Family of the <hi>Stewarts</hi> for ever from enjoying the Crown. This, Sir, you know ſtartled you when you heard of that Attempt; a man that hath but an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Underſtanding, may eaſily judge from hence of the Loyalty of that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of men; I would willingly, Sir, appear to any one of your dear Joys, and ſtand by his Judgment in that Caſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. One Point more, and then, Sir, I ſhall have done upon this Head; and that is the Loyalty of your Popiſh Conſpirators, who to ingratiate themſelves with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſaid Protector, procured <hi>Manning</hi> to be a Spy upon your Brother; and he was not only allowed well by that Party by your direction, but alſo had a very Bountiful Penſion too, by the ſaid Protector; but he was in due time found out, and executed by your
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56278:41"/>
Brother; he was of the ſame Red Letter with your ſelf; and therefore, when dead, he had Maſſes ſung for him as the uſual Reward and Playſter.</p>
            <p>There were other Specimens of their Loyalty, but I forbear to mention them now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are ſome other things to be diſcourſed with you; but this I ſay, That we ſhould have forgotten and forgiven all theſe ſoul Proceedings of your dearly beloved Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Party; and we ſhould not have envied the Security they enjoyed, or the Favours through your procurement they had attained to; provided they had not abuſed them in joining with you to ſubvert the Proteſtant Religion and Government, in turning the one into downright Popery, and the other into <hi>French</hi> Slavery; but alas, good men and true, ſuch an opportunity of promoting the Catholick Religion was not to be loſt; they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Prince converted to ſuch a degree of Zeal and Piety, as not to regard any thing in the World in compariſon of the Converſion of <hi>England,</hi> that hath a long time been op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and miſerably haraſſed with Herery and Schiſm; to accompliſh which, you would aſſaſſinate the King's Perſon, deſtroy our City, murther his Majeſty's Subjects, ſubvert our Religion, and diſturb the Peace of Mankind; and your preſent Deſign that is diſcovered, doth prove beyond all manner of objection and doubt, That that, Sir, throw your Brother's, and your grace and favour, they did then carry on their Deſigns for advancing the Power of the Pope and <hi>French</hi> King, to advance the Religion of the one, and the Intereſt and Government of the other; none daring to ſuggeſt the leaſt thing to bring them under jealouſie, who would not be aſperſed for being Maligners of the King's beſt Friends, and your Fellow-Conſpirators; till one appeared, and took the Popiſh and <hi>French</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt by the Collar, and gave it ſuch a deadly wound, that it could not recover it ſelf to this day, but you were even with him for it, when you uſurped the Government; and ſo I conclude this Head.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond thing that gave you, and your Popiſh Conſpirators, ſuch an advantage for the carrying on you wicked Deſigns and Purpoſes, was the unhappy Diviſions amongſt us poor Proteſtants; for as the Conſpirators improved that little Stock of Credit they had by being for <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt in the Civil War, againſt himſelf and Parliament; and the Prieſts, Jeſuits and Fryars made uſe of that Credit to reduce us to the Obedience of the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo you, and the reſt of the Popiſh Crew, made uſe of our Diviſions amongſt our ſelves, to carry on the ſame Deſign. Now, Sir, there were two main things which did greatly adminiſter to this unhappy Diviſion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Parties divided were come to a more equal Ballance, as to numbers, on each ſide reſpectively, than at any Seaſon heretofore: For, Sir, conſider this, That during the Reigns of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> K. <hi>James</hi> I. and K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. the Diſſenters, from the Eſtabliſhed way of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> were but few, in compariſon of thoſe who were for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, and the Rites and Ceremonies required by Law in their Worſhip and Service of God; ſo that there being little or no jealouſy of any danger to the Church of <hi>England</hi> from the Proteſtant Diſſenters, how zealous ſoever they might be in their way; yet the watchfulneſs of the Prelates, and their Curates, were chiefly exerciſed upon thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Communion: But the Proteſtant Diſſenters ſince are like to the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> very much multiplied, to that degree, that they are come nearer to the other Party, than heretofore they did; the main care therefore of the Prelates, and their inferior Clergy, together with old <hi>Roger</hi> their Guide, did much abate towards their old Friends of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and exerted the ſame to the Proteſtant Diſſenters.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But another great Cauſe of the dividing the Proteſtant Intereſt, was the very ſevere, but juſt Entertainment, the Prelates, with the Scandalous and Ignorant Clergy met with
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56278:41"/>
from the Proteſtant Diſſenters in the late Times of Reformation; when they were reſtored by the return of your Brother from Exile, they meaſured the ſame again to the Proteſtant Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, when they had the Law on their ſide, and your Grace and Favour into the bargain; they remembred all the old Scores, by which great Animoſities and Heats have been between Party and Party; the Prelates aiming then at the ruin of the Diſſenters for aiming at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Prelacy and Superſtition. By this, I ſay, a difference is riſen, that in all humane probability can never be made up.</p>
            <p>We cannot but from hence very eaſily, not only by Reaſon, but by Experience, gather the great uſe you, and the reſt of the Popiſh Party, made of them to carry on their Deſigns for the ſubverting the Religion and Government of this Nation: For, as the pretence of theſe Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions hath been made uſe of as an Argument to pervert ſuch as knew not that the Diviſions of your Synagogue of <hi>Rome</hi> are more numerous, and their Fewds more irreconcileable than ours; ſo ſubtile have your Conſpirators been, by winding themſelves into all Companies; nay, muſtering themſelves in all Parties; endeavoured both to heighten the Differences, to make their Annimoſities not only hotter, but more immortal; and while the one Party of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants have been crying out againſt the other for their Schiſm, and the other crying out againſt them for their Superſtition and Perſecution; you, and your Party, to the reproach of both, were undermining that holy Faith which they equally center in; and carrying a Deſign of deſtroying the one as well as the other, they being, in you eſteem, both equally Hereticks.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A third thing that contributed much to your bringing of Popery and Slavery into theſe Kingdoms, was the general Prophaneneſs and Debauchery which had overſpread theſe Nations beyond what in any former Reign had been obſerved. Sir, You in this, by, and with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, Advice, and Example of the King, your Brother; and your Conſpirators followed the Counſel of Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> in the Year 1654. at <hi>Paris,</hi> when the Popiſh Party were but at a low ebb in <hi>England;</hi> That the only way to accompliſh the Work in <hi>England,</hi> was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch them firſt, and make them Atheiſts; and when that was done, they would ſoon make good Papiſts; for this you well knew, and ſo did your Popiſh Party, That a prophane, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched Perſon is truly of no Religion, and therefore indifferent to ſeem to be of any, as Intereſt and Temptation ſways him; ſo it is plain, that no man cares to be of that Religion, which condemns all thoſe Ways and Practices which he is reſolved to purſue with his utmoſt vigour.</p>
            <p>Do but take notice that the Popiſh Religion was ſuch as would allow them in all thoſe wicked ways to which their vicious Inclinations led them, and doth ſecure them from the horror and dread of Eternal Wrath and Vengeance; for your Religion maketh thoſe to be no Sins, tho committed by ſome againſt the expreſs Command of Chriſt himſelf: If they are ſuch things as the Word of God hath ſet a mark upon as enormous, then they are made Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Offences only; and if they are Sins which your Synagogue calls Mortal, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the moſt daring and prodigious Enormities, through their Doctrines of Pennance and Abſolutions, and Papal Indulgences, you are ſecure from the Pains of the damned in the other World.</p>
            <p>By this means, Sir, you, and your Conſpirators, increaſed the number of your Converts, and ſtrengthened your hands ſo far, that you boaſted to <hi>Beddingfield,</hi> your Confeſſor, That you did not doubt: but in a very few years to have ſuch a number of Catholick Gentlemen, and others, tha you feared not but to have a Catholick Army ſufficient to ſuppreſs the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious Proteſtant Party, in caſe they ſhould rebel; this ſaying of yours <hi>Beddingfield</hi> the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite communicated to the Jeſuites at <hi>Wild-Houſe</hi> upon the 24th of <hi>April,</hi> 1678.</p>
            <p>Nay, Your Zeal was ſuch for the Popiſh Religion, that poor Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> your Chaplain-Naval,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56278:42"/>
and Domeſtick, for oppoſing Popery, was by you turned out of his Imploy, and left as a Sacrifice to that wicked Prelate of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> Dr. <hi>Morlay,</hi> for ſaying, <hi>That it was his fault that your Dutcheſs turneſt Papiſt; and that the ſaid</hi> Morlay <hi>might have prevented the Dutcheſs of</hi> York<hi>'s being ſeduced to Popery, if he pleaſed;</hi> and <hi>that her turning Papiſt was to be laid at his door.</hi> You therefore would not for a long time pay him his Wages, tho that moſt Chriſtian Prelate had ſued him upon the Statute <hi>de Scandulis Magnatum,</hi> to the poor man's utter ruin; for his Living was extended, and he left to periſh for want of Bread: And he had never received his Arrears due to him in your Service, had I not ſhamed old Sir <hi>Allen Apſley</hi> publickly in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> for it, you pretending it was referred to him. Moreover, I told him, If he did not pay <hi>Jones,</hi> I would fetch it out of his old Bones; it was a time Sir, when Men began to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your ſteps, and perceive your Deſigns, ſo <hi>Jones,</hi> much againſt your Will, got his Money, and after that <hi>Jones</hi> had ſuffered ſeveral years Famine from that Villanons Old Prieſt of our Church, and he could not hold his Living from him any longer, he moſt Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly delivered <hi>Jones</hi> from the extent; but <hi>Jones</hi> being ſo ill uſed by <hi>Morley,</hi> he died within a year or two after he had his Living reſtored; but by the way, Sir, by the Dutcheſs of <hi>York,</hi> I mean her that was the Daughter of the Earl of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> ſometimes Lord Chancellor, but the two Ladies your Daughters, were by God's Providence ſaved from being corrupted by you, and your Conſpirators.</p>
            <p>Now Sir it remains that I tell you, or rather put you in mind what Steps your Conſpirators took to ruin theſe Nations; they were, Sir, your Favourites, and! of the ſame Religion, and of the ſame Intereſt with your ſelf, for you having made ſuch Advantages from the three Heads before-mentioned, and by theſe means ſtrengthened you Hands to diſpoſe you to do the Three Kingdoms what miſchief you pleaſed: Therefore it follows, that you now be put in mind what Steps you took for the ruin of the Proteſtant Religion and the Eſtabliſhed Government of theſe three Nations. I ſhall only name theſe few that follow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt great Step that your Conſpirators took to the ruin of theſe Nations, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugate them to Hell and <hi>Rome,</hi> was that wicked Fire of <hi>London;</hi> which was begun, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by your Popiſh Conſpirators, to ruin this great and populous City, that had been for many years the Bulwark of the Proteſtant Religion; which they compleated without the leaſt remorſe or pity: You your ſelf beheld its Flames with Joy, and viewed its Ruins with much rejoycing, as old <hi>Gray</hi> the Jeſuite was pleaſed to ſay in a Letter of his in <hi>November,</hi> 1666. to the Jeſuits at St. <hi>Omers.</hi> Sir, I will not charge you with the actual burning of <hi>London,</hi> becauſe it was below you to be ingaged in the very Act; and you had Rogues mean enough to ſerve you in ſo baſe a piece of Villany; but of this I am certain, That when any were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the Fact, you your ſelf diſcharged them; and not only ſo, but you, and your Guards actually hindered many of the poor Citizens from ſaving their Goods from the Flames, and protected thoſe that did aid and abet the Fire; and ſome of them you preferred; and ſince you uſurped the Throne, you gave them marks of your Favour: As for inſtance, the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon that lived in the <hi>Savoy, a Frenchman,</hi> that went by the name of <hi>Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Upon the whole, Whether you had not a hand in that Fire, I leave all the World, and your own Conſcience, to judge.</p>
            <p>It will not be unneceſſary Sir, to put you in mind of the account I have had of it from ſome of thoſe who were Conſpiratos, and were engaged in the Fact, <hi>Richard Stra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ge,</hi> a great Favourite of yours, and ſometimes your Father. Confeſſor in Ordinary, uſed it as a great Argument to me to go on to aſſiſt the Deſign of the Society, who told me that they got 14000<hi>l.</hi> in the Fire of <hi>London</hi> in the Year 1666. and not only ſo, but you your ſelf
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56278:42"/>
was in their Counſels when it was determined, yea, and your Brother too, which I durſt not for my life diſcover, becauſe of the Promiſe I had made to Prince <hi>Ruport,</hi> not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any thing to the Parliament that might touch the King, but he afterwards heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of his giving, and I did alſo of taking that Counſel, and ſo you eſcaped; for I could not Charge you but muſt Charge him too: But the Prince knew of it, and ſo did King <hi>Charles</hi> himſelf; but this let me tell you, That in a Letter of yours Signed <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> to Father <hi>Courtney,</hi> of <hi>Aug.</hi> 12. 1667. you did declare your Reſentment of the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſiring our Ships at <hi>Chatham,</hi> and what a diſhonour it was to the King and his Friends, but this you ſaid was your Comfort, that <hi>London</hi>'s Pride was ſufficiently pull'd down; and as the burning the Ships at <hi>Chatham</hi> had been the cauſe of much trouble at Court, but it was much allayed by the hopes that Factious City would ſcarce be built again, unleſs to the ruin of the Undertakers; the Fanaticks (ſaid you) may now ſtuddy again the number of the Beaſt. <hi>Langhorne</hi> that had a hand in the Fire by being Privy to it, who ſollicited King <hi>Charles</hi> more in his behalf, than your ſelf and imployed <hi>Portſmouth</hi> that <hi>French</hi> Spy and Whore to uſe her Intereſt to procure his Pardon.</p>
            <p>I ſhall add the Promiſe that I had of your Favour by Sir <hi>Allen</hi> your Truſty Tool, if I would ſpare that part of my Evidence concerning <hi>John Grove,</hi> about his Firing of <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark,</hi> and how you ſollicited for his Life in conjunction with <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> you cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get I am ſure; and the King asked you whether you had a deſire to bring the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about his Ears, for after the Firing of <hi>Southwark</hi> was Sworn againſt him, the King told You and <hi>Portſmouth</hi> too, he durſt not Pardon <hi>Grove.</hi> You cannot forget <hi>Conyers</hi> the <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictine</hi> Monk, who whilſt you were a Votary of that Order, was one of your Father Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors; him you brought into <hi>White-Hall</hi> though Evidence was given in againſt him of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be one of the Murderers of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second; and the King himſelf told the then Lord Chancellor, That if there was no other Evidence againſt him but that of his being to have a hand in his Murder, the ſaid <hi>Conyers</hi> would ſurrender himſelf; but the Lord Chancellor told the King, That there was other Evidence againſt him, of Matters of high Concern; and the Lord Chancellor told you in your Ear, That he would be Charged with the Fire of <hi>London,</hi> at which you were much appaled, and went to <hi>Conyers</hi> who you had planted in the Dark <hi>Lobby</hi> before the Council Chamber, that opened into the Privy Gallery, and you came out to <hi>Conyers,</hi> and bad him ſhift for himſelf; and when the Council ſat down I was called in, and asked if I could make out any thing againſt <hi>Conyers</hi> as to the Fire of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> I told the King I could, and ſo Sir you muſt ſtand Charged in ſome reſpects to have had a hand in Firing of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond Step which you and the unwearied Enemies of the Proteſtant Religion in theſe Realms took towards the Extirpation of it, and the Subverting the Government was, to intereſt the <hi>French</hi> King in your Councels; and you having in a great meaſure engaged him to aſſiſt you with Money, and with what elſe might be convenient for the Executing your Wicked Enterpriſes, I muſt juſtifie this Point from your Letter to <hi>Lechaiſe</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King's <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> wherein you ſay thus<hi>: H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:56278:43"/>
Sir, give me leave to obſerve this to you, the Jeſuits in the Reigns of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and of K. <hi>James</hi> l. till the Match of his Son with <hi>France,</hi> laboured nothing more diligently than the advancing the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to the Univerſal Monarchy of <hi>Europe;</hi> but that Crown being by various ways and means much weakened and rendred wholly uncapable of aſpiring any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that matter, the falſe and treacherous Jeſuits have of late years applied themſelves with mighty diligence to ſerve the Intereſt, and to promote the Grandeur of the <hi>French</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch. In which your own Engagements do ſufficiently appear, for how have you with thoſe firſt-born of Pride and Treachery kindled thoſe Flames of War which have not only laid the moſt flouriſhing Provinces in <hi>Europe</hi> waſte, and rendered the Kingdoms of <hi>Europe</hi> Fields of Blood, and with them do ſtill nouriſh them to the Ruin and the Deſtruction of ſo many millions of men.</p>
            <p>For, Sir, did not you and your Party, by the Intereſts you had in almoſt all the Courts of the Princes of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> influence ſome Princes to a Neutrality, and others to an open Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy with <hi>France,</hi> ſo that now the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy is in truth become very troubleſome to all his Neighbours.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, give me leave to make this Obſervation to you, that the <hi>French</hi> King being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at this formidable Greatneſs, which he hath for ſeveral Years laſt paſt ſtood in; you that plotted and contrived the ruin of theſe three Nations, drew him into your Councels, and obtained his promiſe of Aſſiſtance to the rooting out of Hereſy, and nouriſhing a miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding between the King your Brother, and his People; and this you and your Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators conceived to be a main advance towards the attaining your wicked Ends and Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; for otherwiſe you would not have ſo much laboured the compaſſing that point by your ſelf, and your Servant, <hi>Coleman,</hi> who was taken in the midſt of his pious Labour, and rewarded with the Triple-tree to your great ſatisfaction; for if he had lived, he might have told all, and ſome body elſe might have taſted Death in his place.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, I muſt come cloſer to the Point in hand, that is, your intereſting the <hi>French</hi> King in your Councils; and in your Letter to the ſaid Father Confeſſor to the <hi>French</hi> King, you ſay, <hi>I was much ſatisfied to ſee his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty altogether of my Opinion, ſo I made him anſwer by the ſame means he uſed to write to me, that is, by</hi> Coleman, <hi>who addreſt himſelf to Father</hi> Ferier, <hi>and intirely agreed to his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, as well to what reſpect he had to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of our Intereſts, as the unuſefulneſs of my Lord</hi> Arlington, <hi>and the Parliament, in order to the Service of the King my Brother, and his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, and that it was neceſſary to make uſe of our joynt and utmoſt uſe of our Credits to prevent the ſucceſs of thoſe evil Deſigns reſolved on by the Lord</hi> Arlington <hi>and the Parliament, againſt his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty and my ſelf, which on my ſide I promiſe really to perform; of which, ſince that time I have given reaſonable good proof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I pray, Sir, what was your Opinion? It was the <hi>French</hi> King's Opinion, which was that your <hi>Intereſts were ſo clearly linkt together, that thoſe that oppoſed the one, ſhould be looked upon as Enemies to the other.</hi> Did you agree with the <hi>French</hi> King in any thing elſe? Yes, That <hi>the Lord</hi> Arlington <hi>and the Parliament, were not in your Intereſt, nor in the Intereſt of the</hi> French <hi>King.</hi> And I agree with you, Sir, in <hi>omnibus;</hi> but what of this? Then the Deſigns of <hi>Arlington,</hi> and of the Parliament muſt be prevented: What, I pray, were thoſe? They were to engage the King; if poſſible, to enter into a League offenſive and defenſive with the <hi>States General</hi> of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> and to joyn with the Confederate Princes, and to enter into an actual War with <hi>France,</hi> and to advance the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> by marrying your eldeſt Daughter to him: This laſt was done full ſore againſt yours, and your Brother's Will, but the other were not done; ſo zealoufly you had engaged your Brother in the <hi>French</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:56278:43"/>
That theſe were the Lord <hi>Arlington</hi>'s deſigns, and the deſigns of that Part of the Parliament that gave themſelves Leiſure to deſign, is apparent from what you ſay in the ſame Letter, thus, <hi>Moreover, I made ſome Propoſals which I thought neceſſary to bring to paſs what we were obliged to undertake; aſſuring him, that nothing could be ſo firmly eſtabliſhed, our Interest with the King my Brother, as that very ſame Offer of the help of his Purſe, by which means I had much Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hope to perſwade him to the Diſſolving of the Parliament, and to make void the Deſigns of my Lord</hi> Arlington, <hi>who works inceſſantly to advance the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of the Prince of</hi> Orange <hi>and the</hi> Hollanders, <hi>and to leſſen that of the King your Maſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And did my Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> do ſo? It ſeems he did; and I think it was the only good thing that ever he did; for which he was to be deſtroyed, and the Parliament diſſolved, and every thing that ſtood in the way of <hi>France</hi> and your ſelf; nay, a Parliament that is not in your Intereſt muſt not ſtand. We have ſeen into my Lord <hi>Arlington</hi>'s Deſigns, I pray, what were yours and the French King's, for which you had made ſome Propoſals, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them together: Yours and the French King's Deſigns were to <hi>ruin the Proteſtant Religion,</hi> as <hi>Coleman</hi> in his Letter to the Pope's Internuncio at <hi>Bruxels, Aug.</hi> 21. 74. But <hi>Arlington</hi>'s was to leſſen, and if poſſible, he was to deſtroy the Intereſt of the French King. <hi>You had a mighty Work upon your hands, no leſs than the Converſion of three Kingdoms, and the utter Subduing of a peſtilent Hereſie, which had for ſome time domineered over this Northern part of the World: and you had never ſo great hopes of it, ſince your Queen</hi> Mary<hi>'s Days.</hi> The Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> he had a mighty Work in hand too, and that was to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Intereſt of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who were much in danger of being ſubdued by the French King. You for your Deſigns, next to God Almighty, you relyed upon the mighty Mind of his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, for his Aid and Aſſiſtance: But <hi>Arlington</hi> did rely upon the mighty Mind of an Engliſh Parliament, for their Aid and Aſſiſtance. Your Deſign was to get the Parliament diſſolved and never to have another; His deſign was to have this diſſolved, and ſpeedily to call another: Yours was for advancing the French Intereſt; and his, tho he was a Papiſt, was for advancing the Intereſt of the Confederates, and to leſſen the Intereſt of the French King: You were for Three hundred thouſand Pounds, advanced by the French King, to give the Proteſtant Religion ſuch a Blow as it could not ſubſiſt; but he, for nothing, was to give the French King and his Intereſt ſuch a Blow as that ſhould not ſubſiſt. The French King, by <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> gives you and your Secretary thanks for your Zeal and Service in order to the promoting the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Religion: and I do not queſtion but the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> were as thankful, by their Miniſters at our Court, to the Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> and his Party, for promoting their Cauſe and Intereſt with the Parliament: Your deſign was to eſtabliſh a good Underſtanding between the King your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty and your ſelf, which you ſay <hi>Arlington</hi> and his Party endeavoured, by a thouſand Deceits, to break, to the end they might ſupplant all three of you; but <hi>Arlington</hi>'s Deſign was to eſtabliſh a good Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56278:44"/>
and Intelligence between the Parliament, the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the <hi>States-General:</hi> You ſay that <hi>Arlington</hi> and his Party had uſed a thouſand Deceits to carry on his Rogueries to betray the Councils of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and you and your Party uſed Ten thouſand Rogueries to betray <hi>England, Holland,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to the French King: You ſaid, through the Deceits of the Lord <hi>Arlington,</hi> your Deſigns ſucceeded not, but through your Violence and Folly, his Deſigns ſucceeded to the Honour of God and the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the three Kingdoms and you are living upon the Charity of that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Mankind whoſe Intereſt you advanced whilſt you were here.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, what is all this to the Purpoſe? Yes, it is much to the Purpoſe. You may ſee that the Nation knows well how you intereſted the French King in all your Councils, to change the Proteſtant Religion into down-right Popery, and the well eſtabliſhed Government into French Arbitrary Power; and were not your Party grown to ſuch a height of Inſolence, that they boaſted openly of the Aid and Aſſiſtance the French was to give for the ſetting up the Romiſh Religion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A Third Step you took to ruin the Proteſtant Religion and the well eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Government of <hi>England,</hi> was your unhappy Match with the Daughter of <hi>Modena.</hi> I muſt put you in mind what the Opinion of the then Parliament entertained of that Match, and that you may ſee in theſe following Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it would diſquiet the Minds of the Proteſtants at home, and fill them with endleſs Jealouſies and Diſcontents, and would bring the King your Brother into ſuch Alliances abroad as might prove highly prejudicial, if not deſtructive, to the Proteſtant Religion it ſelf. Now Sir, it was your main Deſign to inflame the hearts of the People, and put them upon a Ferment. And you engaged the King in the ſaid Marriage, as might put him upon thoſe Alliances as might weaken his Eſteem with his People, and ſtrengthen you and your Popiſh Cut-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hroats in your Conſpiracy againſt the Peace and Tranquility of the Nation: For, Sir, in a Letter of <hi>Coleman</hi>'s to <hi>Aſhby,</hi> the Rector of S. <hi>Omers,</hi> he ſaith, you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to let the Fathers know, that that Match was to ſtrengthen the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Cauſe and Intereſt, and that now the King your Brother, who had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in it, would be engaged to unite himſelf in a more near Alliance to his Majeſty of <hi>France,</hi> and the Princes of <hi>Italy, Apr.</hi> 2. 1674.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That they had found by ſad experience, that ſuch Matches had encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged Popery within this Kingdom, and had given Opportunity to Prieiſts and Jeſuits to propagate their wicked and deviliſh Doctrines, and to ſeduce great numbers of the King's Proteſtant Subjects. You that had ſuch a mighty Work upon your hands, as the Converſion of three Kingdoms, and the Subduing of a peſtilent Hereſie which had ſo long domineered in theſe Kingdoms; and it being a great Work, and the Labourers in your great Harveſt being but few, and you being like to meet with mighty Oppoſition, as indeed you did, and an effectual one too, ſo that it did import you to have all the Aſſiſtance you could, that your Labourers might not be out of breath; and tho', next to Gods (or rather the Devil's) Providence, you did rely on the mighty Mind of his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, whoſe Generous Soul had inclined him to many
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56278:44"/>
Barbarous and Traiterous Undertakings; and tho' his Temper was, in that, very much like your own; yet three or four Strings to your Bow, were more than one for the more Alliances abroad with Catholick Princes, would increaſe the Number of your Labourers in the Devil's Harveſt: Therefore in order to this, what Alliances you were engaging your Brother in, you well know, and you cannot forget how all that Deſign was daſhed, and by whom.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, you muſt be ſtone-blind, and ſo muſt your whole Party, if you did not ſee that Experience had taught my Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> and the Parliament how ſuch Matches had been fatal to this Kingdom and to their Deſigns<hi>:</hi> The Match of the King, your Father, with the Daughter of <hi>France,</hi> was the firſt Step that was taken to advance Popery and the French Intereſt in <hi>England;</hi> and when ſhe came over, what a Swarm of Prieſts and Friars followed her; and what Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Prieſts and Jeſuits ſhe protected, and what Numbers were ſeduced in hopes of Employment under her, or of Preferment by her Grace and Favour; and how that unhappy Prince was influenced by her Councils till ſhe had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted a War in <hi>Scotland</hi> by the Influence of that old Incendiary, Cardinal <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu,</hi> and the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the bloody Civil Wars here, which ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in the Ruin, and, by the Juſt Judgment of God, in the untimely end of your Father.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Match of the King your Brother with the Daughter of <hi>Portugal,</hi> by whom he could, through the Bleſſing of God, have no Iſſue: This Lady, what ſhe wanted in Underſtanding to be a Councellour, ſhe had made up to her, in the bleſſed Gifts of Malice, and Treaſon, and Revenge, which ſhe exerciſed to the utmoſt: And what Swarms of Prieſts, Jeſuits, Monks, and Friars were by her protected, and with what Zeal ſhe promoted the Romiſh Religion, and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Men that were in a Conſpiracy againſt our Religion, Laws and Liberties; and how great Numbers were by her Prieſts perverted to the Romiſh Faith, to the great diſquiet of the Government, the Parliament well knew: And therefore, Sir, you muſt know that the Experience they had of theſe two conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Matches, how fatal they had been to theſe Kingdoms, was a ſufficient Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for to interpoſe in yours.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Parliament obſerved how your Deviliſh Popiſh Party were animated by the hopes of this Match before it was conſummate, which were diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the King's Conceſſions at the laſt meeting of that Parliament; you know what they were, the Breaking the Indulgence, and the Paſſing the Teſt Bill. My Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> and the Parliament were very proſperous in their Rogueries (as you called them) thoſe Sons of <hi>Zerviah</hi> were then too many for you and your damnable Crew.</p>
            <p>It is remembred, upon the hopes of this Match, that a Proteſtant could ſcarce come within your Court at S. <hi>James</hi>'s, but he was affronted by your Popiſh Crew, and ſcarce a better Word than Damn you for a Heretick Dog; and when Complaints were made to you of theſe Inſolencies, the Complainer found no other Redreſs than, What Buſineſs had you there? inſomuch that this ſort of Carriage was obſerved by the Parliament, and upon this Conſideration they interpoſed with all their Might, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56278:45"/>
if poſſible, the Conſummation of the intended Marriage to that Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Princeſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They did greatly fear it would occaſion the leſſening the Affections of the People to your Perſon, and for that you were ſo nearly related to the Crown, they deſired that your Honour and Eſteem ſhould be preſerved<hi>:</hi> But had they known of your Trayterous Confederacy with the French King, and with him deſigning to ſubvert our Religion, Laws and Liberties, they would ſooner have addreſſed for your being Baniſhed from the King's Preſence and his Councils for ever, if not to have ſent you out of the World as you juſtly deſerved.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, you may remember, that you once were the Darling of the Nation, and had the Eſteem and Affections of the People, upon the Account of your being the Son and Brother of a King, and ſtood in a very near Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> in the time of your Brothers Reign; but when your Traiterous Deſigns were laid open, the Parliament, <hi>Apr.</hi> 27. 1679. Reſolved, That your being a Papiſt, and the Hopes of your coming ſuch to the Crown had given the greateſt Encouragement to the then diſcovered Conſpiracy and Deſigns of the Papiſts againſt his Majeſty your Brother, and the Proteſtant Religion: Notwithſtanding this Vote of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, you had an impudent Crew that did endeavour to perſwade the Nation, and not without ſome Effect, through the Power of their bold Aſſeverations that you were no Papiſt, but of the eſtabliſhed Religion; only that you were a Prince of more Generoſity and Greatneſs of Mind, than to comply with the Capricio's of a Parliament, in Renouncing this, or Swearing to that, as they ſhould in humour enact; which Roguery in Converſation paſſed with a great many Raſcally Profligate Proteſtants, who would not believe your being a Papiſt, till the day you opened your Chappel or Oratory, the next, or next <hi>Sunday</hi> but one, after you took the Crown.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Parliament was of an Opinion, that for an Age after the Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the ſaid Marriage, at the leaſt the People of <hi>England</hi> would be under continued Apprehenſions of the Growth of Popery, and the Danger of the Proteſtant Religion; and ſo they were an Age before: For when they ſaw ſo many Piracies made on the Dutch Factories in the Years 1663, 1664. and a wicked War commenced in the Year 1665. and the City fired by Papiſts in the Year 1666. and the Papiſts incouraged, not only in the Years afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, but in the Year 1667. and 1668. and Perſons that had a hand in firing the City of <hi>London,</hi> not only protected, but preferred; and the Trpiple League broken, and another ungodly War proclaimed, Prieſts and Jeſuits increaſing in their Numbers, and their Inſolencies and Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: This increaſed the Fears and Jealouſies of the Nation, and your firſt L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dy turning Papiſt and dying ſuch; but when you married an Italian Papiſt, you had more Eyes upon you, and the People by degrees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſee into your Deſigns againſt the Proteſtant Religion and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56278:45"/>
That the Proteſtant Religion was by this means in danger, is beyond Diſputation; for it had three great Enemies conſpiring againſt it, that had made a League together, to deſtroy it and all thoſe Princes and States that did intend to maintain and uphold it, <hi>viz.</hi> your Brother <hi>Charles,</hi> the French King, and your ſelf; and this Confederacy was ſet up to deſtroy the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> the Government of the <hi>States-General,</hi> and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England;</hi> and this the Parliament feared, and therefore they interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this marriage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But here an Objection will ariſe<hi>:</hi> Why ſhould the Parliament ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt this Match, and be ſo zealous in their Interpoſition to prevent this Match with the Daughter of <hi>Modena,</hi> ſince it is plain, you, in view of the World, had been for ſeveral Months ingaged in a Treaty of Marriage with another Catholick Princeſs; yet a Parliament, nay that very Parliament held during the time of the Treaty, and not the leaſt Exception taken at it? To this I Anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Archducheſs of <hi>Inſpruck,</hi> though ſhe was of the Romiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, yet ſhe was an avowed Enemy of the French Cauſe and Intereſt: For obſerve this, there were many Papiſts, which, Sir, you hated, and by your Conſpirators were looked upon with an evil Eye; for the Lord <hi>Caſtlehaven,</hi> that was one that ſerved the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> was one that was uſed very hardly by you; Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby</hi> was alſo very obnoxious to you, and ſo was my Maſter, the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> being one of the Spaniſh Faction, and <hi>Anderſon</hi> the Prieſt, and ſeveral others that I can, when called to it, name, who were Enemies of the French Faction: And this Lady being not of the French Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Intereſt, the Match, through the Influence of the French King, was broken, and this Piece of Fleſh you have was, ſent from <hi>Modena</hi> in her Room.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Match between you and that Ducheſs was never ſo near a Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as this between the Daughter of <hi>Modena</hi> and you was <hi>de non Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parentibus, &amp; non exiſtentibus eadem est Ratio;</hi> the Match did not appear to them; therefore they touched not upon it: But to make ſure, they addreſſed the King that you might not match with <hi>Modena,</hi> or any other Popiſh Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, for ſeveral weighty Conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Houſe of Commons conſidered, that your Princeſs of <hi>Modena</hi> being ſo near a Relation and Kindred to the many Eminent Perſons of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> might give great Opportunities to promote their Deſigns and carry on their Practices amongſt us, and by the ſame means penetrate into the moſt ſecret Councils of the King your Brother, and more eaſily diſcover the State of the whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>It is obſerved, that it is a ſtanding Rule amongſt the <hi>Venetians,</hi> that if one of their Senators have a Relation that is made a Pope or Cardinal, or is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to any great Dignity in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the ſaid Senator with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws from, or is diſmiſſed his ſerving in the ſaid Senate. And the Reaſon is plain: Firſt, Becauſe they will not be impoſed upon by any of that Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; and Secondly, Becauſe they will not have their Councils looked into by
<pb facs="tcp:56278:46"/>
any that belong to the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> nor, Thirdly, Will they have the Secrets of their Government diſcovered to them; and laſtly, they will not have the State of their Commonwealth expoſed to the Cenſure of the Eccleſiaſtical State.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir, You were no ſooner married, but how Letters paſs betwixt the Court of</hi> Rome <hi>and you ſelf, and your ſervant</hi> Coleman. Jan. 4. 1676. <hi>Cardinal</hi> Howard, <hi>writing to</hi> Coleman, <hi>intimates, That Sir</hi> Henry Tichburn <hi>was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by you to be your Miniſter at</hi> Rome, <hi>and rejoyced at the Prorogation of the Parliament; and further ſaid, That if the King would do well, then all would do well: Now, you know what was meant by the King's doing well, that is, if he were removed. In that Letter, he ſaith, he hoped to do you good Service. It is plain, that now not only</hi> France <hi>but</hi> Rome <hi>was alſo to be intereſted in your Councils, to deſtroy the King your Brother, and expoſe the Councils and Secrets of the Government to the View of the Court of</hi> Rome.</p>

               <hi>Cardinal</hi> Howard <hi>in his Letter to</hi> Coleman, Feb. 8. 1676. <hi>ſaith, He doth all he can to ſerve you: He hath writ to Mr.</hi> Haies <hi>at his Brothers, moves, that your Brother's Miniſters, may joyn with the Pope's Miniſters about P.</hi> Furſtenburg, <hi>and about the Peace, and that the Pope will ſend a Miniſter on purpoſe.</hi>

               <hi>In a Letter, on</hi> March 1676. <hi>ſigned Cardinal</hi> Norfolk, <hi>which was ſent by an Expreſs that was to return with what his Maſter and Miſtreſs had to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate. This was a Letter of Credence, and your Servant</hi> Coleman <hi>was to be he asked, who this Meſſenger was; and was accordingly asked, and would not tell, but, Sir, I will; and it was Signior</hi> Con, <hi>that went under the notion of an</hi> Italian, <hi>but was an old Scotch Priest, that was in the Conſpiracy against</hi> Charles <hi>the First, and diſcovered by</hi> Habernfield <hi>to Sir</hi> William Bozwell, <hi>the Engliſh Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor at</hi> Holland, <hi>who diſcovered the ſame to the Archprelate of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>who was in a most Reverend Manner pleaſed to conceal the ſame by that King's Advice and Direction.

            <p>March 14. 1676. <hi>The Cardinal, in his Letter, ſaith, That he ordered Mr.</hi> Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourn, <hi>his Auditor to write—He underſtood that you had received his—That he uſed to direct his Letters for the Portugal Ambaſſador.

               <hi>diſgrace your ſelf, and put the Catholicks in Deriſion, which is the way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them—which if then, the Cardinal and his Confriars muſt ſhut up their Shops—if he had not taken care, the Match between you and the Daughter of</hi> Modena <hi>had been broken off—that a Friend of his at</hi> Paris <hi>firſt ſet the Match on foot—he ſaith, he promoted the Match to ſerve you and the Catholick Religion in</hi> England; <hi>and ſaith, that he and his are in great Power at</hi> Rome <hi>and</hi> Spain<hi>—And ſaith, that it would prejudice you if you were partial—Complains of want of Countenance from the King your Brother—Propoſeth a Barony to be got of the King for him to get Money for—Saith, that it would be no</hi> Scandalum Magnatum, <hi>tho', for a Catholick, than when Sir</hi> Francis Radcliff <hi>was in motion—Takes notice, that the Pope is not ſatisfied with the Education of your Daughters—Deſpairs not of getting a Penſion from</hi> Rome <hi>for your Ducheſs's Secretary.</hi>

               <hi>In Cardinal</hi> Howard<hi>'s Letter of</hi> March 24. 1676. <hi>he takes notice of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of Letters on the 17th and the 20th of</hi> March, <hi>and alſo of your advancing the Catholick Religion, to the Joy of the Pope, by his of the 27th. fully complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Joy—Hopes your Ducheſs would bring forth a happy Roman-Catholick.</hi> Thus, Sir, you ſee what Deſtruction you were then bringing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Nation, by expoſing the King's Secret Councils and the State and Condition of the Nation, to the grand Enemy of the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Intereſt.</p>
            <p>Now I have done with the Steps you took for the Deſtruction of theſe three Nations and the Proteſtant Intereſt in general, I come now to every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Countrey and Nation, in which you may behold your Attempts there in particular; by which it will appear to what Ruine and Miſery you had brought the Proteſtant Intereſt to: Firſt I will begin with <hi>Holland.</hi>

in that Affair; and what was the End of all thoſe Heats and Flames you kindled, but to exaſperate a conſiderable Party of Men againſt your Nephew the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> nay, your Malice againſt that Prince did not ceaſe here, but moſt unnaturally you engaged the King your Brother to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him, and to comply with his and the mortal Enemies of this Nation; which was ſo unnatural, that an Infidel would not have been guilty of ſuch Ingratitude as your ſelf, if you do but remember how the Prince's Father ſerved yours. Your Malice yet went further; for the Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> uſing ſome Arguments with the King to have a more Regard to his Nephew the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the <hi>States-General</hi> of the <hi>United Provinces:</hi> What Care on the contrary did you uſe to prevent any good Intention of the ſaid Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> towards the ſaid Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> and in order to this, you diſpatch'd Letters to <hi>Aſhby</hi> the Rector of the Engliſh College of S. <hi>Omers,</hi> and require him to write to the Confeſſor of the Emperor, to ſatisfie him that the King your Brother intended no leſs than the Ruin of the Confederates, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Empire, and of his Catholick Princes under him, and that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand he furniſhed the Hungarian Rebels againſt his Imperial Majeſty, and found them Money to go on with their Rebellion, and that his Deſign was, not to have any Alliances with his Imperial Majeſty but only in Shew, that he might advance his Nephew the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> and in order to that, he had <hi>brought him over to the French Interest,</hi> which Letter, Sir, I ſaw, and the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions were followed to a Tittle by the Fathers at S. <hi>Omers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In thoſe Letters the <hi>States-General</hi> were to be acquainted with this. Now, Sir, it is well known, that the King your Brother's being ingaged in the French Intereſt, was no Secret at the Court at <hi>Vienna,</hi> nor with the <hi>States-General;</hi> but that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was drawn into that Intereſt, this muſt be ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing: Therefore, Sir, we might eaſily ſee the ſecret Hatred you conceived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Prince and his Cauſe, and Intereſt. You and your Conſpirators could have been heartily glad of being bleſt with ſuch an Ally; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was true to his Cauſe and Intereſt, you by your lying Jeſuits did what you could to create a Jealouſie in the then Confederate Princes, of the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of the Prince, to the Confederacy, and to the Intereſt of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> in order to his Ruin. Theſe Letters that were ſent to the Emperor's Confeſſor, bore Date, <hi>Jan.</hi> 4. 1678. <hi>Stilo Novo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, You may not forget the 12 Jeſuits that <hi>Whitebread</hi> the Provincial of the Jeſuits ſent into <hi>Holland</hi> to create a Belief in the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi> deſigned no leſs than the Subverſion of the Government of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> by procuring his Party to receive and own him as their King, and that it was the Deſign of the ſaid Prince to aſſume the Title and Crown of a King, and change their Government, and make a Seiſure of their Freedoms. Theſe Jeſuits were ſent by Virtue of Letters ſent from <hi>Coleman</hi> in your Name, and Money was ſent over to be received at <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> the Sum was 4000 Crowns, to bear the Charge of the Miſſion into <hi>Holland,</hi> and the Bills were ſigned by one <hi>Busby</hi> a Merchant here in <hi>London,</hi> the Money being paid in by Sir <hi>Allen Apſley;</hi> therefore, Sir, it may well be concluded who was at the Head of this Piece of Villany.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:56278:47"/>
In a word, Sir, you ſee what means you and the reſt of your Popiſh Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries uſed to beget in the Dutch an ill Eſteem of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and to widen the Difference between the <hi>Loviſtein</hi> Party and his Friends; and, if poſſible, to ſeduce his Friends, and deſtroy his Intereſt, and the Intereſt of the Proteſtant Religion: and the beſt Title the Jeſuits of St. <hi>Omer</hi>'s us'd to give him, was <hi>Apple-tree Will;</hi> at which you were pleaſed; in the multitude of your witty Thoughts, to laugh, as <hi>Coleman</hi> us'd to tell us, when ever any Diſcourſe happened concerning the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, Sir, you may ſay, That he was your Siſter's Son, and that at that time you had married your Daughter to him, ſo that he was not only your Nephew, but your Son-in-Law, What then? How you and your Party uſed him, when he was your Nephew, the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> ſaw, and the Honeſt Party of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> reſented his Uſage, and had Thoughts of you accordingly, yea, and of your Brother to; but you pretend that you had married your Daughter to him. No, Sir, it was neither you nor your Brother married the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> to the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> it was ſomething elſe, I had almoſt ſaid the <hi>Siege of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leroy,</hi> and the Advice of a worthy Miniſter of State upon the ſame: But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you had married your Daughter to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and that it was your own Inclination, to which I cannot yet be reconciled in my thoughts, but that after the Marriage you purſued his Ruin with as much vigour as you did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, give me leave to ſum up the whole in a few words: You and your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices reſolved, That the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> ſhould not become Great, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt be deſtroyed; and in order to effect ſo mighty and ſo great a Work, all means are uſed to ſtir up the Dutch to mutiny againſt him, upon that Diabolical Suggeſtion of your Conſpirators, That he had deſigned, and was reſolved to ſubvert their Government, and uſurp a Crown and Title of a King: the Emperor is alſo inſtigated to create a Belief in the States-General, That the Prince deſigned the making himſelf Abſolute; and oh how did you and your Party hug your ſelves with the Expectation of a Breach between him and the States-General, ſo that his and the <hi>whole Proteſtant Intereſt might fail in</hi> Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
               <p>In truth, when a Man reflects upon this Affair, he would wonder at your Barbarity, and naturally ask this Queſtion, Why ſhould this Prince aim at the Deſtruction of the Prince of <hi>Orange?</hi> Was he not his Siſter's Son, his Son-in-law? What profit would it be to you to deſtroy him? An honeſt-thinking Man would heſitate at theſe things; but when he conſiders who it is attempts this, and for what cauſe, then it naturally follows there was a pretended Cauſe for ſuch Diabolical Suggeſtions, and ſuch Barbarous Deſigns.</p>
               <p>You that was his Uncle <hi>was converted to ſuch a degree of Zeal, as not to regard any thing in the World in compariſon of the Converſion of Heretical Kingdoms,</hi> and ſo your Intereſts we know were inſeparately united to the French King, that it was impoſſible to divide them: You know that you uſed all means to ſecure His Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty's Intereſt in <hi>England,</hi> and that for many weighty Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; one among the reſt was, <hi>That his and yours prevailing, would give the greateſt Blow to the Proteſtant Religion that ever it receiv'd from its birth;</hi> then undoubtedly
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56278:48"/>
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (through God's mercy now our Gracious King) at that time ſtood within a ſtep or two of the Throne, and being a Proteſtant, ought in all Policy to be removed, notwithſtanding his being your Nephew, and Son-in-law<hi>:</hi> For what do Men talk of natural Affection amongſt Popiſh Princes? Was you not in a Conſpiracy againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, when he was at <hi>Brux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,</hi> though he was your own Brother, (or elſe he is baſely bely'd?) And was not the Queen, his Mother, zealous in the ſame Conſpiracy, notwithſtanding he was her Son? Why then ſhould any Man talk of natural Affection?</p>
               <p>Sir, you cannot forget that you <hi>had a mighty Work upon your Hands,</hi> that was, The Converſion of theſe Kingdoms, and ſubduing <hi>the Northern Hereſie, and that your hopes of it were very great, and that you were zealous, to a miracle,</hi> of being the Author of ſo Glorious a Work: Your <hi>mighty Mind,</hi> and the <hi>Mighty Mind</hi> of the <hi>French</hi> King, were relied upon by the Conſpirators; for that alſo that the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the <hi>French</hi> King was highly attracted to that of yours. Why then ſhould any wonder at your Paſſing a Bill of Excluſion upon the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who the World knew (notwithſtanding all your Helliſh Suggeſtions both to the Emperor and States-General) ſtood ready with all his might to Baffle You, and the <hi>French</hi> King, and all your <hi>mighty</hi> Undertakings.</p>
               <p>Conſider further, That the Intereſt of the French King was highly attracted to your Intereſt; and this pleaſed you and your Party, and ſo you thought your ſelves ſecure: But here was your Nephew and Son-in-law; his Intereſt was as highly attracted to that of <hi>England, Holland,</hi> and the Reformed Churches of <hi>Europe,</hi> to the Support of the Proteſtant Religion, which You and the French King were to deſtroy by the Name and Title of the <hi>Northern Hereſie.</hi> I pray then what ſignifies a Nephew and a Son-in-law in ſuch a Caſe as this? Can any Man that ever knew you, believe that natural Affection ſhould interpoſe and prevent your deſtroying him, ſince your natural Affection and Bigotry were, and are ſtill no Strangers in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſider once more, and then I have done with this Point: You may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that the French King did moſt generouſly offer you the uſe of his Purſe, to aſſiſt againſt the Deſigns of thoſe that were Enemies to you, and that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch: Nay, you know he proteſted, That thoſe that oppoſed you he ſhould look on them his Enemies; and you did as well proteſt, That thoſe who oppoſed him you would look upon them as your Enemies; and it was the Opinion of the French King, that the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> was neither in his Intereſt nor yours, and you entirely agreed with him in that Thought of his; ſo that it was your Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that it was neceſſary for you both to make uſe of your joint and utmoſt Credits, to prevent the Succeſs of the Parliaments Evil Deſigns againſt you both. What, Deſigns againſt you and the French King? Yes, Deſigns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, and the French King; nay, that which is more, a dangerous Plot. Who are the Plotters? And what was the Plot? my Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> was at work, without ceaſing, to advance the Intereſt of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the Hollanders, and to leſſen that of the French King: And that he and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others were endeavouring to break the good Intelligence between <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, the French King, and your ſelf, wherefore you earneſtly
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56278:48"/>
ſolicited the French King to aſſiſt with the Help of his Purſe, to prevent ſuch Rogueries.</p>
               <p>Thus, Sir, you make a Tripple League, and ſet it up in Oppoſition to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: In the one, King <hi>Charles,</hi> the French King, and your ſweet Self are engaged; in the other, the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> are engaged: The French is to furniſh you with Money, which is the Sinews of War, the Parliament are declared Enemies, King <hi>Charles</hi> ſtands as a Cypher only; and therefore the French King, and your ſelf, put your ſelves under the ſolemn Engagements to perform what was ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated, and ſtrenuouſly to aſſiſt each other againſt the Deſigns of your and the French King's Enemies; for that there was a dangerous and deſperate Deſign on foot, to advance the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and to leſſen the French King: And therefore, can any think that it was unreaſonable in you, to endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him, ſince his Advancement was of ſuch a deſperate and dangerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to the French King, your Self, and Romiſh Religion? Theſe things duly conſidered, no Man that hath his Thoughts and Judgment keeping pace with each other, but muſt from the Premiſſes rationally conclude, That you and your Incendiaries muſt have a deſign of deſtroying the Prince and his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Proteſtant Intereſt in <hi>Holland,</hi> notwithſtanding any Excuſes you may make to the contrary, or your Party for you.</p>

               <head>II. IRELAND.</head>
               <p>Since, Sir, you have not left ſo good a Name in <hi>Holland,</hi> as you might have pretended to, it is much to be feared that, upon enquiry, your Name and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory will not be very precious here in <hi>Ireland.</hi> If you pleaſe to give me your Company thither, I'll aſſure you, if you deſerve it, you ſhall have my good Word from thence, for all the old Favours I receiv'd from you in the Day of your Power here amongſt us; but I ſuppoſe I ſhall find ſad havock there made by you, and your Plotters, of the Proteſtant Religion, and of the Civil Rights, Liberties, and Cuſtoms of the Engliſh and Proteſtant Intereſt.</p>
               <p>Sir, it pleaſed King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second to ſend the Lord <hi>Roberts</hi> as his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent into <hi>Ireland,</hi> who was a warm Man, and not at all Popiſhly affected, and therefore not for your Turn, or one that would gratifie the Conſpirators in any one Point of countenancing Popery, and therefore you procured him to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; ſo that <hi>Ireland</hi> was put into ſuch Hands as your Heart and Soul could wiſh for: For whoever was Deputy, or Lieutenant, your Conſpirator, <hi>Boyle,</hi> an Archbiſhop, was the Governor; a Fellow, 'tho' of the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> yet was a well-wiſher to the Romiſh Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. So <hi>Ireland</hi> was in a fair way to be Over-run and Ruined to all Intents and Purpoſes by yours; and the Procurement of the Jeſuites.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:56278:49"/>
Upon the Removal of the Lord <hi>Robarts,</hi> afterwards Earl of <hi>Radnor,</hi> you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member who ſucceeded him, and what Promiſes was made by this Succeſſor, and what Terms you required from him, and how he complied, and who it was that recommended this new Lieutenant as a Perſon fit, to all Intents and Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to execute your Deſigns: Theſe things are worthy of conſideration I aſſure you, for we have conſidered them; and what could be done in ſo little time as our King hath had, many of thoſe Abuſes have been corrected and amended. This Tool brought the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> into a ſad condition, by encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Popiſh Recuſants, who are the profeſs'd Enemies to the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Engliſh Intereſt; by his, or rather your Encouragement, they grew more Inſolent and Preſumptuous than before that Tool of a Lieutenant came there, which was of a dangerous Conſequence to that Kingdom, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, and Engliſh Intereſt: And it was like to have proved Fatal to that Kingdom, had it not been in ſome meaſure prevented, by the ſending in his room that Great and never-to-be-forgotten Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> whom you and your Party procured to be Murthered in the <hi>Tower,</hi> to make the Murther of the Good Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> leſs difficult.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For in the <hi>Firſt</hi> Place, in the Month of <hi>January</hi> 1672/3. you procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Commiſſion of Enquiry into Iriſh Affairs, containing many Powers that were new and extraordinary, not only Prejudicial to the Engliſh, whoſe Eſtates and Titles were liable to be queſtioned, but in a manner to Overthrow the King's Acts of Settlement, which Commiſſion you cauſed to be purſued, to the great Charge and Attendance of many of the Proteſtants there: And by this means you ſhook the Peace and Security of the whole Kingdom of <hi>Ireland.</hi> It is well known, Sir, that you gave the Jeſuites great Hopes of making a fair Step to eſtabliſh the Romiſh Religion; and old <hi>Gray,</hi> the Jeſuite, in a Letter of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> 1672. exhorts the Fathers at St. <hi>Omers</hi> to be very thankful to God that he had put it into the Hearts of the King and Duke, to remember the ſad E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of the Catholick Religion in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that now there was ſome Hopes of Eſtabliſhing it there, ſince the Lord-Lieutenant was ſo well diſpoſed towards it, by the eſpecial Care of His Royal Highneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">II. You were pleaſed to cauſe the Popiſh Party to be armed in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſome of them were Commanders to others; Inſtructions were given from <hi>Richard Talbot,</hi> then your Agent there, by your Order, for thoſe of the Roman Catholick Party to furniſh themſelves with quantities of Arms; and this, your Conſpirators ſaid, were to keep the Engliſh in order. This, Sir, can be proved whenever there is occaſion. No Man can think, that Sir <hi>Ellis Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> a Papiſt, that was Secretary to the Government, by your eſpecial Grace and Favour, ſhould not purſue the ſame Inſtructions that your Agent <hi>Talbot</hi> had received: Nay, give me leave to tell you, That your dear Brother was highly engaged to reduce that Kingdom to a Popiſh Eſtabliſhment, according to the Agreement he had made with Madam, your Siſter, to whom he had promiſed to begin the Eſtabliſhing the Roman Catholick Religion in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that

High-Maſs ſhould, in a ſhort time, be ſung at St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s, in the City of <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> the Metropolis of that Kingdom.</p>
               <p>It is true, Sir <hi>Ellis Layton</hi> was a lewd Fellow; but there was none that did your Buſineſs, in jeſt, ſo well as he did, for the time of his reſidence in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> For under the Notion of Ridiculing the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> he promoted every Man that was a Papiſt, if he had but common Senſe, and a Place open. And it is well remembred what vaſt Quantities of Arms and Ammunition were daily ſent from <hi>England</hi> to that Place, and conſiderable Quantities both from <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> which your Party uſed to ſay, <hi>would do more good towards the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Catholick Religion than ſo many Bibles:</hi> And great care, Sir, was taken by you, to ſecure the poor Iriſh Catholicks in the North, that the Planters of <hi>Ulſter,</hi> and the Scotch, ſhould give them no diſturbance; that is, in plain Engliſh, they ſhould themſelves ſtand ſtill, and be peaceably murthered by your Iriſh Cut-throats.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How many Popiſh Judges, Juſtices of the Peace, Sheriffs, Coroners, Mayors, Sovereigns, and Portriffs, were made, by your Princely Care, in that Kingdom! And was this for the Preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion, and the Engliſh Intereſt there? No certainly; it is well known, by ſeveral Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of yours to <hi>Richard Talbot,</hi> and Sir <hi>Ellis Layton,</hi> that the Reaſon why you gave ſuch Inſtructions, was to cruſh and ruine the Proteſtant Religion and the Engliſh Intereſt in that Kingdom; for you having Popiſh Judges, and Popiſh Sheriffs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you would quickly find Popiſh Juries, and Iriſh Witneſſes to ſwear any thing againſt the Proteſtant Nobility and Gentry that ſtood in oppoſition to your Proceedings in that Kingdom: Then, Sir, what Security had a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of his Eſtate, when Judges, Sheriffs, and Witneſſes were againſt him? The many Inſtances of the Wrongs and Oppreſſions done to the Proteſtant Engliſh Gentlemen, the Records of your Villainous Court of <hi>Claims</hi> can tell how they were ſworn out of their Eſtates and Fortunes by your Rogues and <hi>Banditti.</hi> I am certain that this Point being gained by You, and your Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators, it proved very Fatal to <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. You took great care of the Church too; not of the Proteſtant Church, but of your Popiſh Titular Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Vicar-Generals, Abbots, and others, that had Power from <hi>Rome</hi> to exerciſe Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, that they ſhould be eſtabliſhed in particular. Sir, your old Friend <hi>Peter Talbot,</hi> the pretended Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and your old Friend <hi>James Lynce,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Tuam,</hi> both of them had been notoriouſly diſloyal to the King your Brother, in that they had long lived in Diſobedience to him, and in Contempt of his Laws: But, to cure that, you procured a Pardon for them both, which <hi>Boyle</hi> the Chancellor paſſed under the Great Seal, by your ſpecial Command and Direction; nay, you hectored your Brother when he was unwilling to paſs <hi>Talbot</hi>'s Pardon, and challenged his Promiſe and Agreement made at <hi>Dover,</hi> at the Interview, with Madam his Siſter and yours: And, Sir, that all things might appear with ſome Face of Grandeur, a Meeting of all the Popiſh Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56278:50"/>
Biſhops, Vicar-Generals, Abbots, Priors, and Prieſts, for the ſettling and eſtabliſhing their Clergy, both ſecular and regular, which was connived at by your Tool of a Lieutenant; upon which the Popiſh Party grew ſo inſolent, that a Proteſtant went in danger of his Life amongſt them: nay, to preſerve their Stock, in many Places they were forced to pay Tythes to the Popiſh Prieſt, as well as to the Proteſtant Miniſter.</p>
               <p>But when the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was ſent over, with much difficulty ſome ſmall Check was put to theſe inſolent Carriages of the Iriſh Papiſts; <hi>Tuam</hi> fled, and <hi>Talbot</hi> withdrew for a while, or rather abſconded themſelves, and the Publick Popiſh Schools were put down, and many ſecular and regular Prieſts did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the Land: For which, Sir, you hated the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and <hi>Plunket</hi> you alſo deſpiſed, becauſe he ſaid, It was not Prudence for Catholicks to live in Contempt of Law; and therefore you may remember how and by whom his end was promoted, and with what zeal you and your Party ſent him out of the World; he was of the ſame Opinion with Cardinal <hi>Howard,</hi> that in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Buſineſs <hi>Talbot</hi> was engaged, he ever ſpoiled it, and he was impudent and falſe to his Party, for which the Jeſuites turned him out of the Society; but that he might not in diſcontent leave the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the General of the Jeſuites procured of the Pope that he might be made a Biſhop. But this, Sir, I will aſſure you, That if <hi>Talbot</hi> when he was taken in <hi>Ireland,</hi> had been taken in <hi>England,</hi> he would have done You and your Party a ſignal Piece of Service; for <hi>Coleman</hi> had certainly given Evidence with him againſt you: So that your traiterous Correſpondency with <hi>France,</hi> and Intentions to deſtroy the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the Proteſtant Religion within theſe Realms, and all over <hi>Europe,</hi> would have been ſo fully detected, that it had been almoſt impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for you to have eſcaped the hand of Juſtice. Of this, Sir, I can give a particular Account, if ever there ſhould be occaſion: And <hi>Plunket</hi> himſelf gave you ſuch an <hi>Item</hi> of <hi>Talbot</hi>'s Intentions in that Point, that <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Death was haſtened, and <hi>Talbot</hi> dy'd ſtrangely in Priſon, and ſo you eſcaped to do more Miſchief: And how well you rewarded <hi>Plunket</hi> for his Good will towards you, is well known; and all to oblige your Cut-throat Jeſuits, to whom they were mortal Enemies.</p>
               <p n="5">5. On the 26th. of <hi>Febr.</hi> 1671. It is remembred, that for the better Encouragement of the Iriſh Papiſts, and that they might many of them live in greater Bodies together, you procured Letters from King <hi>Charles,</hi> your Brother, and a Proclamation, to give Liberty in General to all Iriſh Papiſts to live in Corporations, againſt the Act of Settlement; and to be excuſed from all thoſe Oaths that were required from thoſe who were duly licenſed according to the true intent and meaning of that Act: And your Agents, Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Ellys Leyton,</hi> and <hi>Richard Talbot,</hi> were very vigorous to ſee thoſe Letters and Proclamations put in Execution: Then the <hi>Iriſh</hi> flocked into Towns Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate, and other Market Port Towns of that Kingdom, to the great Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Engliſh Proteſtants, and the Diſturbance of their Trade.

the Proteſtant Intereſt was expoſed to, and what Danger they were in of loſing their Trade both at home and abroad; and how they returned without any manner of Redreſs, but were ridiculed by <hi>Leyton,</hi> and abuſed by your Tool the Lord Lieutenant.</p>
               <p>It is well known that the Iriſh Papiſts (ſome few only excepted) did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Trade, and therefore the End for which they were let in to live in Towns Corporate, and into other Market-Towns within that Kingdom was, that they might over-power the Proteſtant Party and ſeize their Effects as they did in the Rebellion: They began in the Year 1641, and that they might get into Offices in thoſe Towns Corporate, to keep the Proteſtants ſo much under as would incapacitate them to ſtand upon their defence, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> being well armed, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being diſarmed by a private Order from your ſelf to the then Lord Lieutenant, which was diſcovered in the Papers found at <hi>Jolliff</hi>'s houſe in <hi>Weldſtreet,</hi> in <hi>Feb.</hi> or <hi>Jan.</hi> 1678/9, amongſt Papers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Sir <hi>Ellys Leyton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for two or three Years together, great Inquiry was made by ſome of your Conſpirators, for News out of <hi>Ireland;</hi> ſo big they were with the Expectation of a Rebellion there; which certainly had been if it had not been for fear of the <hi>Scotch,</hi> who were well planted in the North of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who with all the Bravery and Reſolution that became honeſt Men and good Proteſtants to ſtand by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> for which Cauſe you did uſe your utmoſt Efforts to have thoſe <hi>Scotch</hi> that were ſo planted in the North of <hi>Ireland</hi> to be diſarmed; but whether at that time your Deſign took effect I cannot well remember.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Furthermore, you to carry on your wicked deſigns and purpoſes in that Kingdom for the better eſtabliſhing of Popery and Arbitrary Power, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging of the Proteſtant Religion and Engliſh Intereſt. You procured Letters of the King your Brother, bearing date, <hi>Septemb.</hi> 28th. 1672. and upon that Letter ſo procured, there was an Order of Council of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in which Letter, and by which Order, the Engliſh Proteſtants were ſtrictly charged and commanded, upon pain of his high Diſpleaſure, not to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Iriſh Papiſts, in any Actions whatſoever, for any Wrongs or Injuries committed by them, during the late Rebellion. Nay, Sir, you would not have it called a Rebellion, but you deſired it might be called rather the late Troubles, which you could not obtain; and rather than your <hi>Teagues</hi> ſhould loſe the Benefit of the ſaid Letter, you were content to have it called a <hi>Rebellion;</hi> and the Reaſon was, you and your Brother too were well ſatisfied who had a hand in it, and firſt ſtirred it up; witneſs, the Parchments that were found in the Red Trunk in <hi>Jolliff</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Weld-ſtreet,</hi> and the Letter written in the behalf of the Marquis of <hi>Antrim,</hi> to your Deviliſh Court of <hi>Claims,</hi> in which the principal Author of that Rebellion was made manifeſt, but that by the Way only.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:56278:51"/>
In that Rebellion, what Murders, Rapines, Thefts, and barbarous Outrages were for ſome time daily committed by the Iriſh Papiſts, upon the poor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, ſome yet alive in both Kingdoms to teſtifie: And yet, of your tender Care of thoſe Barbarous Cut-throats, you would not have them anſwer at Law, for any of the aforeſaid Villanies, and why? Becauſe what they did, was in Zeal for the Catholick Cauſe, to which, you by a Miracle was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, inſomuch, that for the promoting of it, you had regard neither to Law, or Juſtice, Sence, or Reaſon: Nay, ſome that did ſue thoſe Murderers before that damnable Court was ſet up, were much diſcountenanced by your Party there, and by your ſelf here in <hi>England,</hi> if they had occaſion to make any Application to your ſelf for any Favour or Kindneſs.</p>
               <p n="7">7. You conſtituted <hi>Richard Talbot</hi> Agent from your ſelf to the Roman-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, and they conſtituted him their Agent to you from them, for which <hi>Talbot</hi> had a ſufficient Penſion to whore and game withal; and, give the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil his due, he anſwered his Truſt with all the Care, Fidelity, and Diligence both to you and the Popiſh Party. Not only ſo, but you procured for him the ſaid <hi>Talbot,</hi> a Command in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as a Reward for his great Services done. Of this Agency of the ſaid <hi>Talbot,</hi> Dr. <hi>Tongue,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Thomas Jones,</hi> your <hi>quondam</hi> Chaplain, having ſome clear Proof, they made Application to the King your Brother, and he ridiculed the Buſineſs, and ſaid, That <hi>Talbot</hi> was not only a Blockhead, but was in no manner fit for an Agent for any party, he being alſo a Man too much addicted to his pleaſures; and you met with <hi>Jones,</hi> and asked him whether he was turned from a Preacher to an Informer, and told him he had pitched upon a very unlikely man for an Agent. Thus was any Truth, that was againſt Poperty or Papiſts, brought by any honeſt Man, hiſſed of the Stage by your Brother and your ſelf. Sir, I confeſs you would have uſed me ſo when I charged him with a Commiſſion from ſome body, to be General Governour, and Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and the King then told me how <hi>Tongue</hi> and <hi>Jones</hi> had been to inform him that <hi>Talbot</hi> was an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent from the Popiſh Party in <hi>Ireland</hi> to the Duke, and an Agent from the Duke to the Popiſh Party, which he rejected as an improbable thing; but the Story I told him was more improbable: I diſcovered his Agency, and made out that by Letters under the hand of the ſaid <hi>Talbot;</hi> ſo that <hi>Tongue</hi> and <hi>Jones</hi> were juſtified, and you did, in a few Years, ſo juſtifie that part and ſo many particulars of my Teſtimony in that Affair, that your very Paſſive Obedience Rogues began, when it was almoſt too late, to look about them<hi>:</hi> For in time he was General of the Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the time of the Earl of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendon</hi>'s Regency, and after him, to the ſorrow of many Unbelievers, he was by you made Lord Lieutenant.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Your Conſpirators received a Letter from <hi>Talbot,</hi> the pretended-Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> wherein it was expreſsly ſaid, That your Jeſuits in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and others were preparing the Iriſh Papiſts to Riſe in defence of their Liberties and Religion, and to recover their Eſtates, and that if the Parliament that was to ſit
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56278:51"/>
in <hi>England,</hi> did engage heartily with the King, and the King with them in a War againſt the French King, that a place or places ſhould be opened to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the French King's Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> whenever his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty ſhould think fit to ſend one. And by Order from <hi>Coleman</hi> and the Jeſuits in <hi>London,</hi> the Fathers at the Engliſh College at S. <hi>Omers,</hi> were to advertiſe the Father Confeſſor to the French King of the ſame; and other Jeſuits that had an Intereſt in the French King, and the Fathers of S. <hi>Omers</hi> were aſſured that the King your Brother was brought to that ſtate of Security, that if any Male-content among them ſhould not prove true to them and their Deſign, his Majeſty would not give ear to their Information, and therefore prayed them to be diligent, for now was the time or never; and accordingly Meſſengers were ſent to Father <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> viz. <hi>Edward Nevil</hi> your Confeſſor, and <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Busby,</hi> to carry the aforeſaid Letters to <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> and theſe did bring home <hi>La Chaiſe</hi>'s Anſwer, and withal ſeveral Letters that <hi>Coleman</hi> had written to him upon that Affair in your Name, and by your Command, that bore date in the month of <hi>January,</hi> as theſe alſo did in the month of <hi>January</hi> 1677/8. ſome little time before the Parliament ſat down: And then, Sir, there was a Penſion obtained for <hi>Coleman,</hi> your diligent Secretary, of 2000 Crowns a Year, and another from <hi>Rome,</hi> but what that was I do not ſo well remember: But this is not to be forgotten, that the Fathers of S. <hi>Omers</hi> had great Aſſurance of conſiderable Sums from the Pope, and from the General of the Jeſuits, if any Progreſs were made in that Glorious Attempt.</p>
               <p>Here, Sir, you and your Party ſignalize your ſelves in ſeveral particulars worthy of your being put in mind of, 1. The great Preparations that were made for the Riſing of the Iriſh Papiſts. 2. That the great Deſign of Riſing, was for the Defence of their Liberties and Religion. 3. You were not certain but that your Brother might engage in earneſt with the Parliament for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into an actual War with <hi>France.</hi> 4. That in caſe he ſhould, your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators would let in French Forces into <hi>Ireland.</hi> 5. That your Brother was brought to ſuch a ſtate of Security, that if any Malecontent amongſt you ſhould not prove true to you or your Deſign, he would not give ear to their Information.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The great Preparations that were made for the Riſing of the Iriſh Papiſts, and this your Agent <hi>Talbot</hi> was engaged in, and your Secretary <hi>Coleman</hi> was privy to it, and you too, by the Letters that <hi>Coleman</hi> wrote by your Order to the ſaid <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> with whom you your ſelf left this Jeſuit to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond, <hi>Coleman</hi> being a Servant to you, and a truſty one too. But there were many Proteſtants that had their Eyes opened, and made their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of the Carriage of your Teagues, how imprudently inſolent they had been, and how they were Armed and Countenanced by ſome in the Government, and therefore they can atteſt the Truth of this Propoſition of mine, and they are Men of unexceptionable Credit. So that if you will try the Merits of the Cauſe, you may come forth and be heard.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:56278:52"/>
2. That the great Deſign of Riſing was for the Defence of their Liberties and Religion, and the Recovery of their Eſtates. You know, Sir, that you were converted to the Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and you were ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for it, even to a Miracle, that you regarded nothing in the World in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of your Religion: And ſo it was with your Friends here in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and whilſt the Engliſh Proteſtants were uppermoſt, you had inſtilled this Principle in them, by your Jeſuites, and other Conſpirators, that they were but Slaves: And as for thoſe that could not recover their Eſtates, forfeited by Rebellion, by the dint of Perjury, they muſt try by the dint of the Sword to deſtroy the Engliſh Proteſtant Intereſt; or elſe they were not only Slaves, but Beggars too into the bargain.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They were not certain but that the King your Brother might engage in earneſt with the Parliament, in an actual War againſt <hi>France;</hi> you know, Sir, he had been but uncertain in his Proceedings with you in this damnable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, for he had broke the Engagements that he had made with Madam your Siſter, in the Eſtabliſhing the Popiſh Religion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that he had paſſed the Teſt Bill in <hi>England;</hi> and that he refuſed to ſign <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the diſſolving the Parliament, notwithſtanding his ſolemn Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to you and your Party to do it; and that he received the Sacrament in his Chappel according to the Uſage of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> though he had received the ſame but that morning, from <hi>Ireland</hi> the Jeſuit, according to the Rites of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and therefore neither Teague nor your ſelf were ſure of him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In Caſe he ſhould heartily engage with the Parliament, in an actual War againſt <hi>France,</hi> your Conſpirators would let in French Forces into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſo they did when you Trayterouſly Invaded that Kingdom, and what they did for you then, they would have done as much for you eight or ten Years before. They were zealous for the Popiſh Religion, and ſo were you, and your Intereſts were both one, and they are to this day; I think I need not go further to prove that Point.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The King your Brother was brought to ſuch a ſtate of Security, that if any Malecontent amongſt you ſhould not be true to you or your Deſign, he would not give ear to their Information: you know who it was that ſo governed the King, and led him by the Noſe, but you ſuppoſed your ſelves ſafe: But this remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that when Information was made of this Helliſh Conſpiracy, the King your Brother heard it, and the Evidence was ſo ſtrong, and the Plot made ſo plain, that he could not gainſay it, he being in every part of it himſelf, excepting that of his own Life; and was convinced that the Parliament ought to have the Examination of the ſame put into their hands, which was accordingly done. And what the Parliament, that was within ſome few days after the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery thereof to ſit, did do, and what Credit they gave to it, and three other Parliaments, you and your Followers cannot forget.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:56278:52"/>
9. Your Conſpirators, the Jeſuites from St. <hi>Omer</hi>'s, were made acquainted, by Letters, from thoſe of <hi>London,</hi> in conjunction with your Servant <hi>Coleman,</hi> That <hi>William Morgan,</hi> and one <hi>Lovel,</hi> Jeſuites, were diſpatched as Meſſengers into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to ſee how Affairs ſtood there; and this <hi>Morgan</hi>'s, and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion's Charges were paid by the ſaid <hi>Coleman,</hi> who gave them Inſtructions, in your Name, to encourage the Iriſh Papiſts, to defend their Religion and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties: And <hi>Coleman,</hi> and the Jeſuites tranſmitted 2000 Pound for the Supply of their preſent Wants; and a Promiſe of 4000 Pound was, in your Name, made by <hi>Coleman,</hi> and the Jeſuites, in caſe there ſhould be any Action.</p>
               <p>But, Sir, theſe Meſſengers, <hi>Morgan</hi> and <hi>Lovel,</hi> they went away on the laſt of <hi>January,</hi> 1677/8. and returned the latter part of <hi>March</hi> following, and gave ſuch a melancholy Account of <hi>Peter Talbot</hi>'s laviſhing the Money that you had in a ſpecial manner entruſted him withal, and not applying the ſame for the uſe of the Iriſh, as you had directed, that it ſtrook a great Damp upon the Minds of your Conſpirators here in <hi>London:</hi> and, That the ſaid <hi>Talbot</hi> had forged Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts of ſeveral Summs of Money by him pay'd to ſeveral of their Officers, though the ſame were neither pay'd by him, nor yet receiv'd by them; and not only ſo, but that the Proteſtants in the North of <hi>Ireland</hi> were much alarm'd at thoſe Quantities of Arms and Ammunition that were put into the Hands of the Iriſh Catholicks.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Your Conſpirators, <hi>Coleman,</hi> and the Jeſuites in <hi>London,</hi> receiv'd Letters from St. <hi>Omers,</hi> written from Father <hi>Ireland,</hi> (not he that was hanged, for his own Name was <hi>Ironmonger;</hi> but this Man's own Name was <hi>Saltmarſh)</hi> That Care was taken for the Deſtruction of the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he being then Lord-Lieutenant there: And for what Reaſon? Becauſe he had refuſed, Sir, to join with you in Breaking the Engliſh Intereſt in that Kingdom; though, Sir, you may remember, that the ſaid Duke was a Perſon very Obſequious to your Brother, and your Self; and the Reaſon why you could not get him to engage with you in <hi>Omnibus,</hi> was his own Safety and Eaſe. Yet when you acted, by the King's Command, the ſaid Duke never failed you; nor did his Son, the Earl of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> which coſt that good Gentleman many a Sigh when he came to dye; for the Buſineſs of the <hi>Smyrna</hi> Fleet, and the Wicked War againſt the Dutch, ſtuck upon his Soul to the laſt Minute of his Life. But I ſay, Becauſe the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> would not puſh on every thing you put upon him, he was not for your turn; though, give him his due, he had gone far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than his Inclinations lead him, to pleaſe your Mind.</p>
               <p n="11">11. In the laſt place, when you took the Crown, you in a ſhort time put the whole Government into the Hands of the Iriſh Papiſts, by which means the Engliſh Proteſtant Intereſt was in great danger to be loſt; and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Inhabitants were under the daily Fears, through your Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, of having their Throats cut; nay many, daily, by your Cut-Throat Teagues, were, by your eſpecial Direction, baſely, inhumanely, and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly murthered. So that ſome taſted of that Cruelty which others juſtly
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56278:53"/>
apprehended from the Arbitrary Power you ſet up there: Some of them left the Kingdom, and abandoned their Eſtates, calling to mind that Cruel and Bloody Maſſacre which fell upon their Fathers in that Kingdom, in the year 1641. And to crown your Work, you traiterouſly invaded that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and called a Number of your Villains together, and chriſtened them by the Title and Name of a <hi>Parliament;</hi> and what you did by their countenance, many yet alive can tell. But Doctor <hi>King,</hi> an old Paſſive Obedience Friend of yours, hath painted you out at large in thoſe particular Carriages of yours, when you, with your French Mirmidons, invaded that Kingdom.</p>
               <p>But, Sir, let me tell you, That Great <hi>William</hi> our King hath endeavoured, and doth ſtill ſtudy to bring <hi>Ireland</hi> into ſuch a State, that the Settlement of the Proteſtant Religion may there be religiouſly obſerved, and the Proteſtant Engliſh Intereſt may be ſecured againſt any Effort of yours, or your Iriſh Teagues to the contrary notwithſtanding.</p>

               <p>You having play'd your Game ſo well in <hi>Ireland,</hi> it will not be amiſs to caſt our Eye upon that <hi>Quondam</hi> Ancient Kingdom, and ſee how you managed there; for as you managed <hi>Ireland</hi> by a Tool that ſucceeded the Lord <hi>Roberts,</hi> ſo in <hi>Scotland</hi> You and your Brother acted by <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> for he brought all the Laws and Liberties of <hi>Scotland</hi> to the Council-Chamber, bringing all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Cauſes of any moment to your Arbitrary Council, who acted as Lords Paramount without controul; and ſo zealous were you, by him, to promote and ſupport the French Intereſt there, that continually new Levies were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in <hi>Scotland</hi> for the Service of the French King, tho' at that very time we were pretending a French War in <hi>England.</hi> You remember, Sir, that by your Influence upon the King your Brother, and on the Council of <hi>Scotland,</hi> you make them uſe all the diligence that was poſſible to get an Army there, to be a ſtanding Army in the room of the Militia of that Kingdom, the Militia be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not thought fit for your Popiſh Deſigns: And the means to effect the ſame, you pitch'd upon thoſe you judged to be the moſt effectual; which was, firſt to Oppreſs and Enrage the Diſſenters: and this could not be better accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, than by diſturbing and proſecuting their Meetings, and Religious Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies for the Worſhip of God; which You and your Conſpirators did with all imaginable diligence. And you having found out a new way by caution, your Conſpirators deviſed a Bond ſhould be impoſed upon every Man they marked out for Ruine, as being Enemies to their Arbitrary Proceedings; which Bond was, That the Landlord ſhould be bound for his Tenant, the Maſter for his Servant, and the Husband for the Wife, and Father for the Children, not to go to Conventicles: Which you knew many would not do; for that the People of <hi>Scotland</hi> generally hated Praelatical Government. But this way they
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56278:53"/>
thought would ſo enrage the People, whom they fore-knew would not part with their Meetings, that they doubted not but to force a Rebellion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon have a fair Pretence to raiſe Forces for the Security of the Kingdom againſt reſtleſs Meeters and Meetings. Which Deſign, Sir, You and your Party in that Kingdom did at laſt effect.</p>
               <p>Another Device you and your Conſpirators had of ſeizing the Field-Meetings by the armed Forces, and deſtroying them both in Bodies and Eſtates, and drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them to Gaols, and then by whole Ship-loads ſelling them to the Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as Condemn'd Men; and Ship-loads coming here for <hi>London,</hi> they, by one way or another, got their Liberty. Was this of the Bond all? And was the Selling of them all? No: For You and your Conſpirators found out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, by the Tyranny of Duke <hi>Lauderdale;</hi> and that was this:</p>
               <p>There was a Warrant procured from the Council of <hi>Scotland</hi> to diſarm di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Shires and Low-lands of that Kingdom; and when that would not exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them, then another Order was procured to order the <hi>High-landers,</hi> a ſort of barbarous Papiſts, to be armed, and by whole Regiments to come down upon the Inhabitants, ſpoiling and deſtroying the whole Country, living amongſt them at diſcretion; and theſe very <hi>High-landers,</hi> thus armed, under the pretence of keeping the Peace, had, in their Commiſſion from your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's and your Council in <hi>Scotland,</hi> Authority to live at Free Quarter upon thoſe Inhabitants, which they did divers Months together, to the deſtruction of the poor People. And all this was to procure a Rebellion at any rate.</p>
               <p>But leaſt this ſhould be too general, I will deſcend to ſome Particulars, that the thing may be plain, to your Ragged Regiment at St. <hi>Germans,</hi> and your Hell-born Cut-throat Crew here in <hi>England.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Your Conſpirators in <hi>Scotland</hi> did moſt groſly, falſly, and impudently miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent to the King your Brother, and your Self, the Condition of the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Counties of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as if they had been in a State of Rebellion; tho' it is well known that they had never made any Oppoſition to the King's Authority; nor did they reſiſt any of the King's Forces, but pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56278:54"/>
ſubmitted to the Execution of the Laws: But You and your Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors purpoſing to have the King's Authority to carry on your ſiniſter Deſigns, You, with your Conſpirator <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> and the reſt of your Popiſh Crew, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed the King (who was not difficult in that Point to conſent) to raiſe an Army againſt the Proteſtants in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and a Letter was ſigned by your Brother, and ſent to the Council of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Upon the Receipt of this Letter, your Conſpirators, the Council of <hi>Scotland</hi> made out Orders for the Raiſing an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of about Eight or Nine thouſand, the moſt or which were Popiſh <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers:</hi> Which, Sir, was ſo wicked a Contrivance, that the Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the Weſtern Counties did ſend to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and for the Security of the Peace did offer to engage, That whoſoever ſhould be ſent, the Laws ſhould be put in execution, and ſhould meet with no Affront; and that they would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Hoſtages for their Safety. Yet this Army ſo raiſed by You, and your Conſpirators, with the Colour of the King your Brother's Authority, was marched into a Peaceable Country, and did, according to their Commiſſions, take Free Quarter; and in moſt Places levied great Summs of Money, under the Notion of Dry Quarters; and did Plunder and Rob the Proteſtants, of which no Redreſs could be obtained, though Complaints were daily made of theſe Barbarities: For your Brother and You were reſolved, that nothing ſhould ſatisfie your Cruelty, but the extirpation of thoſe who did not comply, without reſerve, with your Arbitrary Proceedings.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it was apparent, that your Deſign was not only to deſtroy thoſe that went to Field-Meetings, but alſo the whole Proteſtant Intereſt; for thoſe that were Field-Meeters, were but tenderly uſed, in compariſon of thoſe who went to Church, who were moſt quarrered upon, and deſtroyed; thoſe of the Field-Meeters, parting with their Moneys to be excuſed as long as they were able; and when thoſe poor Wretches had no more Money to ſatisfie your dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gooning Apoſtles, they were miſerably uſed by them: By which means ſeveral Families were Ruined, and brought to ſtarve for want of Bread.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Proteſtants alſo were required to ſubſcribe exorbitant and illegal Bonds, which was impoſſible to be performed by them, which was againſt the Law of Nature, which is, no Man is bound to impoſſibilities, <hi>viz.</hi> That they, their Wives and Children, Servants and Tenants, ſhould live orderly, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Law, and not go to Conventicles, or entertain Vagrant Preachers, with ſeveral other Particulars; by which Bond, thoſe that ſigned it were liable to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for all Men's Tranſgreſſions that lived upon their Lands: Which was ſo hard a Caſe, that <hi>Coleman</hi> himſelf thought, that if that did not make them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, nothing would.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That many of the Proteſtants of that Kingdom, within thoſe Counties, were proclaimed Rebels, and Writs iſſued forth for the ſeizing of their Perſons, upon their refuſing the aforeſaid Wicked and Illegal Bond; and the Nobility and Gentry within thoſe Counties, who had been ever faithful to the Crown,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56278:54"/>
and had appeared in Arms for the King, were Diſcharged upon Oath, and a Proclamation was by your procurement Iſſued out, forbidding the Nobility and Gentry, upon great Penalties, to keep any Horſes above Four pounds Ten groats a Piece.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That the Proteſtant Nobility and Gentry of the Shire of <hi>Ayre,</hi> at your Inſtance and Suggeſtion, were, by the King's Order to the Advocate-General, indicted of High-Treaſon, and other high Crimes and Miſdemeanours. Theſe Indictments were delivered to them in the Evening to be anſwered by them the next Morning upon Oath, and when they did demand two or three days time to conſider of their Indictments, and craved the Benefit of having Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to adviſe withal in Matters of ſo high Concernment, and alſo excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their being put to ſwear againſt themſeves in Matters that were Capital; thoſe deſires were rejected, and were told they muſt ſwear inſtantly, or be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted guilty.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Notwithſtanding the Impoſition of the Oath was illegal; and the deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Time to conſider of their Indictments; and to have Lawyers allowed them to adviſe withal, had never been denyed to the greateſt of Malefactors; nor, indeed, could be by the Laws of that Kingdom, yet for all this, theſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen and Gentlemen knowing their Innocency of all that had been charged upon them, did purge themſelves by Oath, of all the Particulars that were objected to them, and were thereupon acquitted, and though the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in the Committee of Council uſed the ſevereſt manner of Inquiry to diſcover any ſeditious or treaſonable Deſigns, which were pretended as Grounds for marching that Army into thoſe Weſtern Counties, yet nothing ever could be proved. So falſe was that Suggeſtion concerning a Rebellion then deſigned by them, though heartily deſired by you and your Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Oppreſſions, notwithſtanding the Acquittal of thoſe Noblemen and Gentlemen of the ſaid Counties, continuing upon them, they went to <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> to repreſent to the Council the heavy Preſſure they and their People lay under, and were ready to offer to them, all, that in Law, or Reaſon, could be required of them, for ſecuring the Peace: The Council being Conſpirators with your Vice-Tyrant <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> I did immediately upon their appearing there, ſet forth a Proclamation, requiring them to depart the Town within three days, upon very great Penalties. And when the Duke of <hi>Hamilton</hi> did peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for leave to ſtay for two or three days longer upon ſome very urgent Affairs of his own, that was refuſed him.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That when ſome Perſon of very great Quality, had declared to the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain <hi>Lauderdale</hi> that they would go and repreſent their Condition to the King, ſince they could not have Juſtice from his Miniſters. But to prevent that, a Proclamation was ſet forth, forbidding all the Subjects to depart the Kingdom
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56278:55"/>
of <hi>Scotland</hi> without Licenſe, ſo that the King might not be acquainted with the Condition of the poor Proteſtants, and that they might not apply to him for Redreſs though it would have been to little purpoſe, he, and you, and this <hi>Lauderdale</hi> being in the Conſpiracy to have them deſtroyed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Give me leave in the Second Place, to remember you of ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſons that were Oppreſſed by you and your Wicked Inſtrument, the ſaid Duke <hi>Lauderdale;</hi> they were Perſons of great Note, for their Quality and Worth, and their Oppreſſion ſo great, that the Proteſtants in <hi>Scotland</hi> were apprehenſive that all Proteſtants might be, upon the ſlighteſt Occaſions, brought under the like Oppreſſion; for you, and your Conſpirators there managed your wicked Deſigns and Purpoſes with all the Dexterity and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that Men that had a Mighty Work upon their Hands, and Mighty Minds to go through with it, could do for you and your Party; there being of the Council upon many occaſions proceeded to a new kind of Puniſhment; for thoſe who would not comply with your Villanous Deſigns of bringing in of Slavery, ſo that Popery might the more eaſily be introduced into that Kingdom, <hi>viz.</hi> Of declaring Men of Publick Truſt, whereby the greateſt Perſons were Robbed of their Honour, and a Stain laid not only upon them but upon their Poſterity alſo; nay, the Parliament it ſelf was Branded with Infamy, by ſuch a Severe and Illegal Sentence by <hi>Lauderdale</hi> himſelf in the time of the Lord <hi>Middleton</hi>'s Government, yet he by your Procurement, and the expreſs Command of your Brother King <hi>Charles,</hi> cauſed it to be done in the lower Courts.</p>
               <p>I will Sir, for the ſatisfaction of your Bloody Cut-Throats, both here at home, and your ragged Crew at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> put you in mind of ſeveral Inſtances in which that Ban-Dog <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> ſerved your Brothers and your wicked Deſigns and Purpoſes.</p>
               <p>You may remember the Twelve Worthy Proteſtant Citizens of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> that were declared uncapable of Publick Truſt, againſt whom no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint was made as can be made out, againſt you; but you will ſay, What was the Cauſe? Then I Anſwer, Theſe Men being Magiſtrates of that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, refuſing to part with the publick Money of the City to <hi>Lauderdale</hi> for what Uſes you know well enough, they, I ſay, were turned out, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators of your own Stamp put in their Places, and then the Publick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was drawn out of the City's Bank at the deſire of the Conſpirators.</p>
               <p>The Provoſts of <hi>Aberdeen, Glaſcow,</hi> and <hi>Gadburgh,</hi> were put under the ſame Sentence for Signing a Letter to the King your Brother, in a Convention of Boroughs, Stating a true Account of their great Oppreſſions by the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators; which Letter was Signed by the whole Body, and the Letter was adviſed by your Brother's Advocate, as a Letter that had nothing in it which could bring them under any Guilt; yet thoſe were there ſingled out of the whole Number, and Incapacitated, beſides, a high Fine and a long Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

Sir <hi>Patrick Hume,</hi> ſince a Peer of that Kingdom, not of your Creation, but of the Creation of our Gracious King that now is: This worthy Perſon being ſent by the Shire of <hi>Berwick,</hi> to complain of ſome illegal Proceedings, in Order to obtain a legal Remedy and Redreſs, which he did only in the Common Form of Law, was alſo declared uncapable of Publick Truſt, beſides many Months impriſonment; and ſince then, he was another time impriſoned for almoſt one whole Year, and nothing ever was charged upon him.</p>
               <p>The Provoſt of <hi>Linlithgoe</hi> being complained of, for not furniſhing ſome of your Brother's Forces with Baggage-Horſes, was called before the Council, and becauſe he ſaid they were not bound in Law to furniſh Horſes in ſuch a manner, he was immediately declared Incapable of Publick Truſt, and was both fined and impriſoned.</p>
               <p>Your Conſpirators, as they were diligent, doing yours and the Devils Drudgery, they ſometimes out-did themſelves to pleaſe you; for at one time they incapacitated 50 of the Town of S. <hi>Johnſtons,</hi> upon a very ſlight Pretence; inſomuch that they could not find a ſufficient number of Citizens for the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy of that Town.</p>
               <p>It is well known, Sir, that for your Brother's Service and yours, and for the carrying on of your curſed Deſigns in that Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, upon ſlight, and, oftentimes, upon no Ground, were impriſoned, and ſometimes kept Priſoners for many Months, nay Years, though nothing hath been objected to them. Some have been required to enter themſelves Priſoners, contrary to the Laws of that Kingdom; a particular Inſtance you made of Lieutenant-General <hi>Drummond,</hi> whoſe great Loyalty could never be forgotten, he was required to enter himſelf a Priſoner in the Caſtle of <hi>Dunbarton,</hi> where he was kept for eighteen Months time, nine of which he was made a cloſe Priſoner; yet nothing was objected to him to give the leaſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for that uſage.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Cardroſs,</hi> a Man of great Virtue and Integrity, was for his Lady's keeping two meetings in her Houſe, though he was preſent at neither of them, fined Eleven Thouſand Pound Sterling; and was kept ſeveral Years a Priſoner in <hi>Edenburgh</hi> Caſtle, and was a frequent and a long Petitioner for his Liberty, and could not find for a long time the leaſt Inclination in any of the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators; nay, Application was made to the King, but from your incenſing the King againſt him, his Petition was rejected.</p>
               <p>Beſides all theſe illegal Impriſonments, the King your Brother, and your ſelf, had Rogues of a deeper Dye; they were Officers in your Cut-throat Army in <hi>Scotland;</hi> theſe carried with them General Warrants for the apprehending of any Perſon that the Conſpirators had a ſpite to, though under no legal Cenſure, nor have been ſo much as cited to appear, which put many of the poor Proteſtants to very great Fears as alſo to great Expence (Juſt, Sir, as your <hi>Atterburies</hi> and the reſt of your curſed Meſſengers did here in <hi>England</hi> in the time of your Tyranny.)</p>

Captain <hi>Caſtaires,</hi> a notable Villain, and fit for a Dragooning Apoſtle for the Devil's Service and yours, did intrap one <hi>Kirkton</hi> an outed Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, into his Chamber at <hi>Edenbourgh,</hi> and did violently abuſe him and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to extorted ſome Money from him; the Noiſe of this coming to the Ears of one <hi>Baily,</hi> Brother in Law to the ſaid <hi>Kirkton,</hi> he came to the Houſe, and hearing him cry Murder, Murder, forced open his Chamber Door, where he found his Brother in Law and the Captain grapling; the Captain pretended he had a Warrant againſt <hi>Kirkton,</hi> and <hi>Baily</hi> deſired him to ſhew it, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that all Obedience ſhould be given to it; but the Captain refuſing to do it, <hi>Kirkton</hi> was reſcued. This was only delivering a Man from one of your Robbers according to the Law of Nature. The Captain complained of this to your Conſpirators, and the Lord <hi>Hatton,</hi> with others of the ſame Kidney, were appointed to examine the Witneſſes; and when it was brought before the Council, the Duke of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Morton</hi> and <hi>Dumfrize,</hi> and <hi>Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardin,</hi> the Lord <hi>Cocheren,</hi> and Sir <hi>Archibald Primroſe,</hi> then Lord Regiſter, deſired, that the Report of the Examination might be read; but that not ſerving the Deſigns of your Conſpirators, was denied: Thereupon thoſe Lords delivered their Opinions, That ſince <hi>Caſtaires</hi> did not ſhew any Warrant, nor was cloathed with any publick Character, it was no Oppoſition to the King's Authority, in <hi>Baily</hi> to reſcue the ſaid <hi>Kirkton:</hi> But for this Opinion, the King your Brother, and your ſelf, and <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> put theſe Lords out of the Council, and out of all Command in the Militia, and though it could have been made appear that he had no Warrant at all againſt <hi>Kirkton,</hi> but procured it after the Violence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and it was antedated on deſign to ſerve a turn at that time; yet the ſaid <hi>Baily</hi> was fined 6000 Marks and kept in Priſon for a long time; which ſort of Proceedings put the poor Proteſtants under ſad Apprehenſions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now, Sir, I pray remember how your Conſpirators uſed the poor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants when they had them in Priſon. There was fourteen Men taken at a Field Meeting, who, without being legally convict of that or any other Crime, were ſecretly and in the Night taken out of a Priſon upon a Warrant ſigned by the Earl of <hi>Linlithgo,</hi> and the Lords <hi>Hatton</hi> and <hi>Collington,</hi> and were delivered to Captain <hi>Maitland,</hi> who had been Page to Duke <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> but after, a French Officer, and was making his Levies in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and were carried over to the Service of the French King, in the Year 1676.</p>
               <p>Your Conſpirators in <hi>Scotland</hi> did, for your Brother's Service and yours, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many Occaſions proceed to the moſt unreaſonable and arbitrary Fines ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for ſlight Offences, or for Offences where the Fine is regulated by Law, which they have never conſidered when the Perſons were obnoxious to them. So the Lord <hi>Cardroſs</hi> was fined 11000 <hi>l.</hi> for his Ladies keeping two Meetings in his Houſe, and Baptizing a Child by an outed Miniſter, without his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; the Provoſt formerly mentioned, and <hi>Baily,</hi> and many others were alſo fined without any Regard had to the Law.</p>

4. Give me leave, Sir, to put you in mind of a fourth Piece of Villany acted by you and your Brother upon the Proteſtants of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Your Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators, by your Brother's Authority, and your Procurement, did ſeveral times proceed to take away Gentlemens Dwelling houſes from them, and to put Garriſons into them, even in the time of Peace, contrary to all Law, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and Reaſon. In the Year 1675, it was deſigned againſt twelve Proteſtant Noblemen and Gentlemen, and executed upon the Houſes of the Earl of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar,</hi> the Lord <hi>Cardroſs,</hi> the Lady <hi>Lumſden,</hi> &amp;c. and it was again attempted in the Year 1678, upon the Houſes belonging to the Lairds of <hi>Cheſnock, Blaghan</hi> and <hi>Rowallane,</hi> and they were poſſeſſed by Souldiers and declared Garriſons: Nor did it reſt here, but your Conſpirators ſent Orders, and required the Countries about thoſe Houſes, to furniſh them for the uſe of your Souldiers, and to ſupply them with Neceſſaries, contrary to the Laws of that Kingdom: It was againſt this, that Sir <hi>Patrick Hume,</hi> now a Peer of <hi>Scotland,</hi> applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Conſpirators to have Redreſs; and common Juſtice being denied him, he uſed a legal Proteſtation in the ordinary Form of the Law of that Kingdom, and was thereupon kept many Months in Priſon, and declared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of all Publick Truſts.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I muſt put you in mind how you by your Conſpirators endeavoured to kindle a Flame amongſt the <hi>Scotch;</hi> for ſince you had diſobliged ſo many of them, and had begot ſuch a Diſaffection in them againſt you and your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; your great Deſign was to keep that Diſaffection alive, and not only ſo, but ſo to increaſe it, as to make them riſe and take up Arms in their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; therefore in order to this in the Year 1677, <hi>April</hi> 19. the Letters of your Conſpiring Jeſuits, to the Procurator-General at <hi>Madrid,</hi> gave him notice, that your Conſpirators at <hi>London,</hi> the Fathers of the Society, had ſent for <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> three Jeſuits in Maſquerade to give the poor provoked <hi>Scots</hi> to underſtand theſe three things<hi>:</hi> 1. That all the Miſeries, under which they groaned, was from the Biſhops and their Clergy, which Doctrine they were inclined enough to believe, they naturally hating the Government of the Church by that ſort of Men, as being againſt the expreſs Word of God, and tending to Tyranny. 2. That there was no other way to recover their Liberty and Religion, but by the Sword; and this was certainly true, for they had made all the humble Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications that could be made by Men, both to the King your Brother and the Council in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and could find no Redreſs of their Grievances; for as theſe Villains were ſent to exaſperate them on the one hand, ſo you and your Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>Lauderdale</hi> augmented their Miſeries on the other hand, and all in Order to make them take up Arms in their own Defence. 3. That the King your Brother was ſo addicted to his Pleaſure, that he neither would nor could take care in that Concern, but left them to be redreſſed by thoſe that cruelly oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them; which was as notoriouſly true: and you wanted not your wicked Inſtruments to accompliſh the great Deſign you had in hand, of enſlaving the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56278:57"/>
Proteſtants of that Kingdom, ſo that the Method you took, by your Jeſuits, by their Inſinuations, and by your Task-maſters to oppreſs them, you did very much incline them, to take up Arms againſt your Conſpirators in their own Defence.</p>
               <p>Sir, Your Jeſuits in <hi>Scotland</hi> laid not aſide their Attempts there, to make the diſtreſſed Proteſtants riſe; for the whole Popiſh Party was at Work to ſtir up the Commotion, by them deſigned, in that Kingdom, as appears by Letters from thence, from your Incendiaries, of the 11th. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1678. Nay, that the Work might take effect, Eight thouſand Scots that were of the Romiſh Religion ſhould be ready, For what? to join with the diſaffected Scots: Such Sots you employed, as if the diſaffected Scots would join with them. But the Truth of it was, to Pillage and Deſtroy the Habitations of thoſe that ſhould riſe in the Defence of their Lives, Liberties, and Religion; for that was the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, whatever Imaginations your Cut-throat Jeſuites had in their empty Nod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, that appears in their Pacquet of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 10th. 1678. directed to <hi>John Grove:</hi> For you muſt remember that was your Deſign, and <hi>Lauderdale</hi>'s, tho' your Jeſuites thought, that the poor Proteſtants might be brought to join with the Popiſh Party, to make a Commotion there: for when your Secretary peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Contents, he laughed at the Folly of the Scotch Jeſuites, but ſaid, If the Scotch would riſe, he cared not with whom they joined; for their Riſing was the thing that was deſired.</p>
               <p>Your Deſign had its effect; for their Provocations were ſo many, and their Oppreſſion ſo great from <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> and his wicked Party, who were ſerving your Brother's, and your Popiſh Deſigns, to bring that People under a deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Power, and the Inſolencies of your impudent Clergy was ſuch, that they could no longer bear; and therefore in the Year 1679. they did raiſe Forces, and armed them; and by their Declaration they were far from carrying on a Popiſh Deſign; for their Deſign was the Extirpation of Popery, and Popiſh Prelacy, out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which had been a great Grievance to that Kingdom. And becauſe, Sir, you may have forgotten their Declaration, I will give it Word for Word, and is as follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>AS it is not unknown to a great Part of the World, how Happy the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> was whilſt they enjoyed the Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt in Purity and Power, of which we have been deplorably deprived, by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment of Prelacy; ſo it is evident, not only to impartial Perſons, but to profeſſed Enemies, with what unparalell'd Patience and Conſtancy the People of God have endured all the Cruelty, Injuſtice, and Oppreſſion, that the Will and Malice of Prelacy and Malignants could invent, and exerciſe. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt unwilling to act any thing which might import Oppoſition to lawful Authority, or engage the Kingdoms in War, although we have been all along groaning under the Over-turning the Work of Reformation, Corruptions of Doctrine, Slighting of Worſhip, Deſpiſing of Ordinances, the Changing the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb facs="tcp:56278:57"/>
Church-Diſcipline and Government, Thruſting out ſo many of our Faithful Miniſters from their Charges, Confining ſtraightly, Impriſoning, Exileing, yea, and putting to Death many of them, and Intruding upon their Flocks a Company of Inſufficient Scandalous Perſons, Confining, Impriſoning, Torturing, Tormenting, Scourging, and Stigmatizing Poor People, Plundering their Goods, Quartering upon them Rude Soldiers, Selling their Perſons to Foreign Plantations, Horning and Intercommuning many of both Sexes, whereby great Numbers, in every corner of the Land, were forced to leave their Dwellings, Wives, Children, and Relations, and made to wander as Pilgrims, ſtill in Hazard of their Lives, none daring to Recet, Harbour, or Supply, (though Starving;) or ſo much as to ſpeak to them, though upon Death-bed, without making themſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the ſame Puniſhments. And theſe things acted under colour of Law, in effect tending to baniſh not only all Senſe of Religion, but alſo to extinguiſh all natural Affection, even amongſt Perſons of neareſt Relations, and likewiſe groaning under the intolerable Yoak of Oppreſſion in our Civil Intereſt, our Bodies, Liberties, and Eſtates; ſo that all manner of Outrages have been moſt arbitrarily exerciſed upon us, for a Tract of ſeveral Years paſt, particularly in the Year 1678. by ſending us an armed Hoſt of Barbarous Savages, contrary to all Law, and Humanity; and by laying on us ſeveral Impoſitions, and Taxes, as formerly, ſo of late, by a Meeting of Prelimited and Over-awed Members in the Convention of Eſtates in <hi>July,</hi> 1678. for keeping up of an armed Force, intruſted (as to a great part of it) into the Hands of avowed Papiſts, or Favourers of them, by whom ſundry Invaſions have been made upon us, and moſt exorbitant Abuſes, and incredible Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies committed againſt us; and we being continually ſought after, while meeting in Houſes for Divine Worſhip, Miniſters and People frequently appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and moſt rigorouſly uſed; and ſo being neceſſitated to attend the Lord's Ordinances in the Fields, in the moſt deſert Places; and there alſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hunted out, and aſſaulted, to the effuſion of our Blood, and killing of ſome, whereby we were inveitably conſtrain'd either to defend our ſelves by Arms at thoſe Meetings, or be altogether deprived of the Goſpel preached by Faithful Miniſters, and made abſolute Slaves: At one of which Meetings, upon the Firſt Day of <hi>June</hi> inſtant, being the Lord's Day, Captain <hi>Graham,</hi> of <hi>Claverhouſe,</hi> being warranted by a late Proclamation to kill whomſoever he found in Arms at Field-Conventicles making Reſiſtance, did furiouſly aſſault the People aſſembled; and further, to provoke, did cruelly bind, like Beaſts, a Miniſter, with ſome others whom he had found that ſame Morning in Houſes; and ſeveral being killed on both ſides, they knowing certainly that by Law they behoved (if apprehended) to dye, they did ſtand to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and continue together; and there, after many of our Friends and Countrymen being under the ſame Oppreſſion, expecting the ſame meaſure, did freely offer their Aſſiſtance. We therefore thus inevitably, and of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Neceſſity, forced to take this laſt Remedy, (tho Magiſtrates having ſhut the Door by a Law againſt Application, that whatever our Grievances be, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               </p>
               <p>This, Sir, you know, was the Declaration of theſe Bleſſed Servants of God, but you had not filled up the meaſure of your Sins, and therefore God was pleaſed to deliver theſe miſerably enſlaved wretches into your hands, and they were made a prey to your never to be forgotten Cut-throats; and ſome of them ſealed their Teſtimony of Jeſus with their Blood: You may remember what Havock your Popiſh Crew made of them both in their Eſtates and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, that <hi>Scotland</hi> was a Field of Blood, through many Barbarous Murders that you by the Hands of your Party Committed there.</p>
               <p>Some of your bloody Crew here, eſpecially the Tyrant <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> were exceeding glad of the News of theſe poor Proteſtants Riſing, and your Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Conſpirators and their Motly Proteſtant Admirers and Abettors did prick up their Ears at the News, and concluded the Day was their own. Our Engliſh Popiſh Army was to cut their Throats firſt, and then the Throats of all Engliſh Men that ſtood in their Way afterwards. And <hi>Lauderdale</hi> highly valued himſelf upon this Riſing (for Poſts came every day to <hi>White-hall</hi> to bring the News of their Increaſing) boaſting that now the Fanaticks had ſhewed themſelves in their Colours; and that it was by that ſtrict hand that he had kept over them in <hi>Scotland</hi> that had been the Cauſe of their being quiet ſo long, hoping by this to get Honour for his prudent Management, when all Mankind knows that his Management was with a Deſign to make them take up Arms: And it was you and he that raiſed that Devil; but, Sir, you know whom you had appointed to betray them. Sir, you were in <hi>Flanders,</hi> thither the News was ſent to you, not becauſe you were ignorant of the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance; but it was a Watch-word for your Return: But that you might lay this Devil, which you and your Conſpirators had raiſed, and kill two Birds with one Stone; therefore you pitch'd upon the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> that he might deſtroy the Proteſtants there, and that his Perſon might either fall in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or his Reputation be ruined here at home; therefore by your Advice or rather Direction, he is ordered for <hi>Scotland</hi> in all haſt, for it was the Grief of your Soul to ſee him the Darling of the Proteſtants of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. Beſides, Sir, you knew, that if he went Armed into <hi>Scotland,</hi> without Aſſent of Parliament in both Kingdoms, by an Act made in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſt, was High Treaſon and therefore the Conſequences might be fatal to him every way.</p>
               <p>However he went by the general Conſent of the Council, and was well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by Vertue of his Commiſſion given him, and draws the Army in <hi>Scotland</hi> together and faces theſe poor Wretches; and indeed, as Matters had been managed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> it was a great Queſtion if the Forces
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56278:59"/>
in <hi>Scotland</hi> would have been prevailed with, with ſo little Difficulty to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to go out againſt theſe innocent and oppreſſed Country-men of theirs, had it not been to go under the Command of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> who marches up to the Enemy, they by their Petition deſire Liberty of Religion, and offer to lay down their Arms; it being given out by your Party, that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> had a Power of giving them Terms, but that could not be done by him, for your Blood-hounds never intended they ſhould have any Quarter given them, therefore he had not that Power in his Commiſſion, of granting any Terms as was promiſed him: Nay, if I am not miſtaken, after that he had left <hi>London,</hi> the Inſtructions that he had to grant Terms were recalled before ever he arrived in <hi>Scotland;</hi> ſo that ſome of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors intended well, and though all things were promiſed not long before to be acted before their Faces above-board, yet they were miſtaken; for all the chief of their Conſults were privately acted amongſt your Popiſh Crew, the French Ambaſſador, and your Prieſts, at the Ducheſs of <hi>Portſmouth</hi>'s Lodgings; and to give them a Reputation, the honeſt Part of the Council ſitting as Cyphers, all was done as by an Order of the King and Council.</p>
               <p>Well, what then? The Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> engaged with theſe poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but your Rogues, and Trickers, and Officers amongſt theſe poor Souls, ſoon left them, before the Battle was begun; ſo that the Pains of Reducing them was not very great nor hazardous, and divers of theſe poor Proteſtants were murdered upon the place by one <hi>Oglethorpe,</hi> an eminent Cut-throat, yet alive, notwithſtanding they cried for Quarter, which was promiſed them; but how well that Promiſe was kept, was ſeen; many hundreds of them having been murdered in cool Blood, under a Colour of Law as if they had been Traytors: So that the Duke comes home a Victor in the ſence of ſome, and a vanquiſhed Perſon in the minds and affections of others, who would not, out of Love to him, have had him engaged with ſuch an ill Company of Cut-throats in ſuch a thing in <hi>Scotland,</hi> they knowing it hazardous in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Reſpects; however, for his own Security, he procured his Pardon for that Action. But that Pardon though it was an Act of great foreſight in the Duke, yet the Judgment of Heaven purſued him; for as he contributed to the Murder of ſo many poor Proteſtants by the Help of Popiſh Cut-throats, ſo he himſelf was murdered, and his Friends, by you and your Popiſh Cut-throats</p>
               <p>It will not be amiſs, Sir, to put you in mind of your Cut-throat <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> of whom you made ſuch uſe and who complied againſt his Underſtanding, Judgment and Conſcience (if he had any) with you and your Brother in all thoſe Villainous Acts and Barbarous Inhumanities in <hi>Scotland.</hi> I will now ſhew the Opinion that our Engliſh Parliament had of that Monſter of Mankind.</p>

1. Remember, Sir, the Addreſs of the Houſe of Commons to the King your Brother, on <hi>April</hi> 23. 1675. for then they found that ſome perſons in great Employment under that King had fomented Deſigns againſt the Intereſt of the Subject, intending to deprive <hi>Great Britain</hi> of its ancient Rights and Liberties, that thereby they might the more eaſily introduce the Popiſh Religion and Arbitrary Government, to the ruine and deſtruction of the Subjects thereof, amongſt whom they had juſt cauſe to accuſe, for a promoter of ſuch Deſigns, the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> becauſe it had been teſtified in their Houſe by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Members of Parliament, That in a Hearing before the Council, in the Caſe of Mr. <hi>Pennyſtone Whalley,</hi> who had committed Mr. <hi>John James</hi> contrary to the King's Declaration of the 15th of <hi>March</hi> 1671, the ſaid Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> did publickly affirm, in the preſence of the King your Brother, and before ſeveral then attending the Board, that the King's Edicts were to be obey'd, for that they were equal with the Laws, and ought to be obſerv'd; in the firſt place thereby juſtifying the ſaid Declaration, and the Proceedings thereupon, and declaring his Inclination to Arbitrary Councels, in terror of all good Proteſtants. This, <hi>Sir,</hi> was not all, but they had a farther confirmation of this Opinion by two Acts of Parliament, of a very ſtrange and dangerous nature, which they had found in the printed Statutes of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the firſt whereof was in the third Seſſion of the firſt Parliament held under the King your Brother, <hi>Cap.</hi> 25. and the other in a ſecond Parliament, <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. the like had never paſſed ſince the union of the two Crowns, and were contrary to an Act paſſed in the fourth year of the Reign of <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, your Grandfather, which intended the better abolition of all memory of Hoſtility, and the dependencies thereof between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the better repreſſing the Occaſions of Diſcord and Diſorders for time to come; and of a like Act paſſed about the ſame time in <hi>Scotland;</hi> by the force of which ſaid late Acts there was a Militia ſetled in that Kingdom of Twenty thouſand Foot and Two thouſand Horſe, who were obliged to be in a readineſs to march into any part of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> for any ſervice wherein your Brother's Honour and Greatneſs might be concerned; and they were to obey ſuch Orders and Directions as they ſhould from time to time receive from the Privy Council of that Kingdom: By colour of which general words the then Parliament did conceive that the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> was lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be invaded upon any pretence whatſoever. And this was done by the procurement of that <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> he having been all the time of thoſe Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions Principal Secretary of that Kingdom, and chiefly intruſted with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Affairs of State there, and he being Commiſſioner for hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Parliament at the time of paſſing the latter of the ſaid Acts, whereby the providing the ſaid Horſe and Foot was effectually impoſed upon that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and that extraordinary Power veſted in the Privy Council there; ſo that the Commons of <hi>England</hi> conceived they had juſt reaſon to apprehend the ill Conſequences of ſo great and an unuſal Power, eſpecially ſince at that time the Affairs of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> were managed by the ſaid Duke, who pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd himſelf to be a Perſon of ſuch pernicious Principles; thereupon they pray'd the King your Brother to diſmiſs him from all his Employments, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56278:60"/>
him his Preſence and Counſels for ever, as a perſon obnoxious and dangerous to the Government.</p>
               <p>This, <hi>Sir,</hi> is the Character, and theſe are the Qualifications of a perſon that your Conſpirators judg'd meet for a man to ſerve your Cauſe and Intereſt; and how near he brought the People of <hi>Scotland</hi> to the French Government and Intereſt, I muſt leave an impartial Reader to judge; he wanted nothing but a King to make an Example of him and all ſuch profligate Monſters of Mankind. But I will give you a ſecond Inſtance of the good Opinion that the Commons of <hi>England</hi> aſſembled in Parliament had of this Varlet; and that is as follows.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Upon the 10th of <hi>May,</hi> 1678, the Commons of <hi>England</hi> aſſembled in that Parliament repreſented to the King your Brother, the deplorable condition the ſtate of the Kingdom, thro' evil Counſellors, which, <hi>Sir,</hi> you know were your Conſpirators, and were deſigning to overthrow the Proteſtant Intereſt in both Kingdoms, and were the Cauſe why the King your Brother follow'd not the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Parliament for the redreſſing of Grievances, amongſt whom they reckon'd <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> and pray'd that the King would remove him from his Council and Preſence for ever.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I haſten to a third Inſtance of the Opinion that the Commons of <hi>England</hi> had of the ſaid Duke of <hi>Lauderdale;</hi> and that was in a Parliament held in <hi>May</hi> 10th, 1679. They tell the King in their Addreſs, That they found the Kingdoms involv'd in imminent dangers and great difficulties by the evil deſigns and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Counſels of ſome who had been, and were then, actually in high Places of Truſt and Authority about the Perſon of the then King, who, contrary to the Duty of their Places, by their arbitrary and deſtructive Counſels, tending to the ſubverſion of the Rights, Liberties, and Properties of the People of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and the alteration of the Proteſtant Religion, did endeavour to alienate the Hearts of the People from the then King and his Government, amongſt whom they had juſt reaſon to accuſe the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> for a chief promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſuch Counſels, and more particularly for contriving and endeavouring to raiſe Jealouſies and Miſunderſtandings between the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> whereby Hoſtilities might have enſued, and might have riſen between the two Nations. They took notice of the many repeated Addreſſes of the immediate preceding Parliament; and were much concerned that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Addreſſes they found that Duke <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> with all his Qualifications, continued in the Councils of the then King, for that the Affairs of the Kingdom required that none ſhould be put into ſuch Employments but ſuch as were not only of known Abilities, Intereſt and Eſteem in the Nation, but alſo were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all ſuſpicion of miſtaking or betraying the true Intereſt of the Nation. Upon theſe Conſiderations a new Parliament pray'd the then King to remove him the ſaid Duke <hi>Lauderdale</hi> from his Employments, and Perſon, and Councels for ever.</p>
               <p>You well know, that in the Month of <hi>February</hi> 1678, you were baniſh'd into <hi>Flanders,</hi> before the meeting of the new Parliament, (for the good King your Brother parted with his old Penſioners, who lowed very loud for want of Fodder, and to ſave Charges, that ſtale Parliament was diſſolv'd and a new one
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56278:60"/>
call'd) whom your Conſpirators, by the inſight they had in the Elections, knew it would be ſuch a Parliament as was not for their turns; therefore a deep Conſult was held, how to make the Nation to believe that they were in earneſt; they reſolv'd to diſcover the Plot, and diſcourage <hi>Popery,</hi> tho' in truth it was the two things you and your Conſpirators aimed at to be ſtill ſupported. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to blind the Eyes of Mankind, it was reſolved that all imaginable ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms ſhould be publickly profeſſed, both for the diſcovery of the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> and leaving you and your Conſpirators, for you were to abſent your ſelf from your Brother, and go beyond Sea for ſome time, upon theſe Conſiderations; the one was, That you being out of the way, might ſtop the further examination of the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> then newly diſcover'd to the King, who was in every bit of it but that of his own Life; and it had a near relation to your ſelf: And by this means your Conſpirators thought to preſerve the Chief Conſpirator alive and ſafe. The other was for a gloſs, to make Mankind to think that the King your Brother and the Court were ſuch mortal Enemies to <hi>Popery,</hi> that he would not endure you his <hi>Popiſh</hi> Brother near him, for fear of being influenc'd by <hi>Popiſh</hi> Councels. But, Sir, you may remember, that your ſelf and Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors at St. <hi>James</hi>'s were of a different Opinion, ſome of your Partiſans with all their might and skill oppoſed your leaving the Kingdom, for that it would weaken your Party extreamly, and make perſons more bold to come in and give Evidence againſt you when you were abſent than if you were preſent, and that if you were abſent, tho' by the Royal Command of your Brother the King, yet the People would be ready enough to ſay you fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d for fear, and that it was in effect to own your ſelf guilty. Such Arguments as theſe were uſed by your Conſpirators, but the Whore <hi>Portſmouth</hi> carry'd it for your going; therefore a Command was ſent to you all of a ſudden, That it was your Brother's pleaſure you ſhould be gone.</p>
               <p>This, Sir, fill'd many with amazement, who knew not for what ends ſuch Counſels had been taken; and it filled others with great Joy, they now belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that the King your Brother, and his Court, would have been purg'd from <hi>Popery</hi> and his <hi>Popiſh Councels,</hi> and the Popiſh Fabrick, which had been ſo long a building, would again tumble down, when they ſaw you that were the chief ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter of it had left your ſtation.</p>
               <p>Well, Sir, away you go for <hi>Flanders,</hi> as if you had been going into another World; but your Conſpirators were not a whit daunted, but reſolv'd to ſtick as faithfully to you as you had done before to them. And tho' by this depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of yours many of your Conſpirators, for whom the Kingdoms were too hot, and who ought to have danced a Gambrel at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> under the pretence of being your Servants, yet notwithſtanding, the hardieſt and boldeſt of your impudent Crew ſtaid behind, and watch'd Affairs at home, letting nothing be done that was material but what was done by your Advice and Direction and theirs; and by your being abroad, they had the opportunity of ſtudying and adviſing what was fit to be done at home.</p>
               <p>This, Sir, I muſt obſerve to you by the way, that before you could be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd upon to go, you were faithfully promiſed, that nothing of value or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56278:61"/>
ſhould be done or acted without you; nay, the Speech that was to be made at the Opening of the Parliament was concluded on before you went: Yet for all this, at the Meeting of the New Parliament, which was now become almoſt a Wonder in this Nation, a great panick Fear was ſtruck in all or moſt of your Crew, and they certainly had ſo much Fear upon them, from the leaſt to the greateſt, that they were even ready to cry Quarter, or at leaſt to offer terms of accommodation, the Nation being in a very great ferment; and your Party, that had rely'd ſo much upon the mighty Mind of the French King for Mony, began to curſe him for driving them upon theſe Extremities; nay, you your ſelf did not ſpare to revile him for the ſame.</p>
               <p>The King your Brother happening to be indiſpos'd at <hi>Windſor,</hi> which being poſted over to you, you return with all ſpeed, and unexpectedly; and being here, you had but a little inclination to return to <hi>Flanders</hi> again; but the King plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing you with ſome private Reſolutions of his, you did ſubmit to return again to <hi>Flanders,</hi> where you was as coldly received as at firſt; but your ſtay was not long there, for the Coaſt being then clear, you reſolved upon returning home, and did accordingly return; and the deſign, you know, was then to fix the <hi>Sham Proteſtant Plot</hi> you and your Conſpirators had contriv'd: But that would not keep you in <hi>England,</hi> for it was reſolv'd that you ſhould go to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to ſettle the Proteſtant Religion there, where you receiv'd the ſad News of the baffling the <hi>Sham-Plot</hi> that you and yours had thought to charge upon ſome <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> which made you take new Meaſures, and you reſolv'd to part with a ſmall ſpell of Mony to get the Parliament prorogued for ſome longer time, and a greater Sum was preſſed from <hi>France,</hi> but without ſucceſs; for the Duke of <hi>Bucks</hi> ſpoil'd that Deſign, for which piece of ſervice you owed him a Cake, and was reſolv'd, if it had not been timely prevented, you would have beſtow'd upon him a whole Loaf. But that by the way.</p>
               <p>Well, you arrive in <hi>Scotland,</hi> I pray how were you receiv'd? with great Joy to your <hi>Banditti</hi> there: Nay, the moſt excellent Proteſtant Biſhops receiv'd you with tokens of Welcome, and highly reſented the Affront that the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> had put upon you, when they went about to exclude you, and very honeſtly declar'd againſt it; and tho' the Commons of <hi>England</hi> were ſo dim ſighted, as not to ſee that the only way to ſettle the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> was by a <hi>Popiſh King,</hi> yet they could ſee it, and declare it as an undoubted Truth. Now, Sir, it was expected that you ſhould admire the Fabrick that your old Friend <hi>Lauderdale</hi> had ſo delicately contrived, and in reward of his good Service ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his Intereſt: No, no, you no ſooner got into <hi>Scotland,</hi> but you were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning againſt <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> he being the great Inſtrument of ſending you thither, for you never forgave him that Affront; ſo that after your arrival in <hi>Scotland</hi> his Intereſt much dwindl'd away. Thus you rewarded one of your old Friends, who had ſold Body and Soul and all to the Devil to ſerve you and your Cauſe; he is gone to his place, I fear, in ſure and certain expectation of Wrath and Vengeance, for the many Villanies he had committed againſt the Religion, Laws and Liberties of his Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:56278:61"/>
Whilſt, Sir, you were in <hi>Scotland,</hi> you and your Conſpirators made your Deſigns to go on to your full content, tho' much diligence was us'd and pains were taken in the point: and to give you and your Accomplices that which is your due, you never did ſpare your Pains for the bringing on your wicked De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to perfection; and you thought it good Policy and your beſt way to make ſure of ſomething, that if <hi>England</hi> ſhould be too hard for you, yet you reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make ſure of <hi>Scotland:</hi> And, to repeal thoſe Laws that were in force, which did debar a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prince from inheriting that Crown, therefore you got a Parliament call'd, and your ſelf made High Commiſſioner. Upon this you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour the Point, for the choice of the Commoners that ſhould be fit for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and to cajole ſome of the Lords, you entice <hi>Hamilton</hi> to come into your Intereſt. You mounted the Throne as High Commiſſioner, without regarding the Law, or due Qualifications neceſſary in taking the Oaths, for that was below you: And the King having furniſh'd you with Letters, you are admitted into the Council without taking the Oaths: But being got into the Houſe, you carried all before you, and got your Succeſſion to the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſecured by an Act; and you got a Teſt paſſed, by which all were to ſwear not to endeavour to alter that Government either in Church or State; and all ſuch as refuſed were to loſe their Employments. In a word, you made every thing to paſs that you and your Crew had a mind to.</p>
               <p>As you were a Privy Councillor in that Kingdom, you wheedled in the Duke of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and admitted him one of the Council, who was very zealous for the Proteſtant Religion formerly, but then began to be very cool: And ſo were the reſt of the cajoled Lords, they all put on the Temper that <hi>Scotchmen</hi> uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are attended withal, that is, to be falſe to the Cauſe that is perſecuted; for, upon the riſing of the Parliament, they ſuffer'd the poor Diſſenters to be ſquee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to death, and ſuffer'd all imaginable Severities to be uſed towards them. You ſucceeding ſo well in Parliament, you uſed great Endeavours for a ſtanding Army, under the notion of ſecuring the Peace againſt thoſe Diſſenters and Field Meeters; but tho' you had labour'd hard in that point, yet the Succeſs did not anſwer your expectation ſo fully as to give you content.</p>
               <p>Well, Sir, what becomes of old <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> your faithful Servant and dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved Favorite, for I do not find him in this Parliament? No, he's forced to ſtay in <hi>England,</hi> not daring to appear in <hi>Scotland,</hi> for his Hell hounds were not able to weather the Point, becauſe the Stream run ſo ſtrong againſt him (not that you had made any change of his Meaſures in the Conſpiracy againſt the <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> unleſs it were for the worſe); and very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous you were of getting him into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and no doubt you would have ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him a Scotch Maiden Trick: Why ſo? Becauſe that Old Dog had been heard to ſay, that all you had done in <hi>Scotland</hi> was nothing, in regard the Oaths were omitted; and, that the Parliament was but a Convention and what you had done was in it ſelf void, and of no effect. Theſe were bloody words, and highly reſented by you; and afterwards you had an Eye upon <hi>Argyle,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſnort at the Teſt; and though he had been a Dog in a String to your Brother and your ſelf, ſome Qualm came croſs his Conſcience: He therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56278:62"/>
to make his Interpretations upon it, which were ſuch as cut the Throat of the thing it ſelf: And altho' the Interpretation he gave could be no other than the genuine ſence of the thing, and plain to be underſtood, that it could mean no other than what he intended to take it in, yet it was ſo much diſliked, that he was then to have been made a Sacrifice, under the notion of being guilty of High Treaſon, only for explaining the Teſt; he was accordingly ſeized and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt, and found guilty of the Fact, and he was then in a fair way to have loſt his Life for his Ingenuity, but he, with a great deal of dexterity, made his eſcape, and ſo ſaved himſelf for that time from being murder'd by you and your Cut-throats there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scotland,</hi> Sir, you bridled and ſaddled, and brought the Government there to be ſomething like the French Mode, differing nothing but that you had made the <hi>Scots</hi> the greater Vaſſals of the two: And the People of that Kingdom careſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed you highly for the grace and favour of their Vaſſalage, notwithſtanding which, you were not willing to ſtay any longer there, your Friends adviſing you by all means to return to <hi>England,</hi> to ſecure your Intereſt in <hi>England,</hi> you having ſetled <hi>Scotland</hi> to your content. And this remember, Sweet Sir, that the Whore <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> with her Baſtard Son, was by your Royal Brother ſent to <hi>France,</hi> to renew the <hi>Dover</hi> Treaty, in which ſhe was more ſucceſsful than your Siſter of bleſſed memory, for ſhe was careſſed by the French King, and her Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard honour'd as a Prince of the Blood, and ſhe ſetled a firm Correſpondency between <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> purſuant to the Treaty at <hi>Dover.</hi> This you heard of, and you judged the Strumpet was undermining you, and obtaining the Succeſſion for her ſon, which made you after your arrival at <hi>Whitehall</hi> more unwilling to return again for <hi>Scotland</hi> than before; and you preſſed the then King your Brother for your ſtay here; but you were told, that you muſt return to <hi>Scotland,</hi> where your ſtay ſhould be but ſhort; you obeyed, and went by Sea, with your chief Favourite <hi>Mumper,</hi> who with you was like to have been loſt, but you ſaved your ſelf and the Curr, and loſt ſome Treaſure, with a great part of your Retinue, who drank your Health, and went to the bottom. But you arrive in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Mony being loſt, your Intentions of having a ſtanding Army there were ſunk alſo.</p>
               <p>Your ſtay was to be ſhort in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſo ſhall mine; therefore ſince I have put you in mind of your bridling and ſaddling that poor Kingdom, as a Subject and a High Commiſſioner for King <hi>Charles,</hi> give me leave to remember you of your Carriage when you pretended to and uſurped that Crown as King of <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for by the Laws of that Kingdom all <hi>Popiſh Princes</hi> were uncapable of that Crown: And becauſe of your Omiſſion of the Oaths that were to be by you ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, all that you did in repealing them was null and void, and to no effect; ſo that thoſe Laws were ſtill in force againſt you, notwithſtanding the aforeſaid pretended Repeal; for without thoſe Oaths the meeting together of Lords and Commons was no Parliament, but a Convention, which cannot repeal any Statute there. Upon your taking that Crown, the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> upon the 20th of <hi>May</hi> 1685, well knowing how the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> muſt ſuffer in <hi>Scotland,</hi> lands in <hi>Scotland</hi> near a place called <hi>Kentire,</hi> and on the <hi>21ſt</hi> ſent forth his Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56278:62"/>
wherein he tells the <hi>Scots,</hi> That the End of his coming was the defence of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> the Laws and Liberties of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> againſt <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Government,</hi> and therefore he required all perſons from ſixteen to ſixty to come and joyn with him, with Arms and Proviſions ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. One of his ſons ſent Letters to ſeveral Gentlemen upon the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, ſo that in few days his Army was encreaſed to 2500 Men. But, <hi>Sir,</hi> your Trappan that betray'd the poor <hi>Proteſtants</hi> at <hi>Bothw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ll bridge,</hi> 1679, eſcaping the Gallows, lived to betray this poor Gentleman, in the year 1685. for, inſtead of ſhewing him the true way wherein he ſhould have marched, provided Rogues who led him into a bogg, from whence he returning towards <hi>Glyde,</hi> was fallen upon by ſome <hi>Scots,</hi> and taken; and, <hi>Sir,</hi> by your Arbitrary Order he was baſely murder'd at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> on the 30th of <hi>June</hi> following.</p>
               <p>This man had all along fought in your Brother's Cauſe and Quarrel, and was an Inſtrument to betray his Father to your Brother, and was murder'd in the beginning of his Reign after his Return. This man had ſerved your Cauſe and Intereſt in <hi>Scotland</hi> many years, and had run in the ſame exceſs of Riot with your Conſpirators, but God opened his Eyes to ſee your baſe Deſigns againſt the Religion and Liberties of his Country, and therefore nothing would ſatisfie you but his Blood, and the ruine of his whole Family. Well, he is dead, but I muſt ſay of him, he deſerved better Fortune in the World, and more Favour from your Hands and his that is gone to his place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scotland</hi> did another time become a Field of Blood; and till it was, you were not contented. But the <hi>Scots</hi> being weary of theſe perpetual diſappointments, they ſubmitted to your Government, and you then declared, by the Advice of your Villanous Conſpirators, eſpecially the damn'd Biſhops, that you were clothed with an Abſolute Power, and that all your Subjects of that Kingdom were bound to obey you without reſerve; upon which you did aſſume an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power both over the Religion and Laws of that Kingdom: From all which it's apparent, what you did when you were Duke of <hi>York</hi> was in order to compleat the Work when you came to be King <hi>James.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe great and inſufferable Oppreſſions of the poor <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the open contempt of all Law, Juſtice, Sence, and Reaſon, together with the ſad Conſequences that moſt certainly followed upon it, did put thoſe poor People under great and juſt Fears, and did thrice make them offer at ſuch lawful Remedies as were Allow'd by the very Law of Nature, tho' it was not with that effect that was deſir'd, <hi>Lauderdale</hi> and your other Conſpirators did endeavour to make all men to apprehend the loſs of their Lives, Liberties Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and Eſtates, if they ſhould go about to preſerve themſelves from your great Oppreſſions by Petitions, Remonſtrances, or other means the Law did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of: So you did by ſeveral <hi>Scotch</hi> Noblemen and Gentlemen, to their utter ruine; therefore what Obligation you have laid upon the Kingdom in general, or any one <hi>Proteſtant</hi> in particular, both before and ſince your pretended Reign there, I leave it to your ſelf and Conſpirators to judge: And therefore bleſſed be God for delivering that Nation from your Tyranny and Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>

               <head>IV. ENGLAND.</head>
               <p>NOW we have ſeen your particular Projects that you and your Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors purſued to ruine <hi>Holland, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> I think it will not be unneceſſary to put you in mind of the Pranks you and your Party play'd both before and ſince you uſurped the Imperial Crown of this Kingdom, and then you will ſee whether you can expect that any honeſt <hi>Engliſhman</hi> ſhould ever engage for your return again in Peace to this Nation. Therefore I ſhall uſe this method: 1. I ſhall ſhew you how far you were engag'd in the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of turning the Civil Government into downright French Slavery, and our Proteſtant Religion into Popery, before you took the Crown. And, 2. I ſhall ſhew you what you contributed to it after. 3. I will ſhew you the unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the attempting your return hither: On which Particulars, I hope, you have leiſure enough to reflect, and adviſe about with your worthy Miniſtry you have attending your perſon at St. <hi>Germains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I. I will ſhew you how far you were engaged in the Conſpiracy of turning the Civil Government into downright French Slavery, and our Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion into Popery, before you took the Crown. When God was pleaſed to reſtore you and your Brothers, you may remember that you came into a Land <hi>flowing with Milk and Hony,</hi> for its Plenty, and a well-govern'd Country, for Religion and Virtue. But this agreed not with the Complexion of your Souls, you had another Game to play, and this I found in a Letter of yours from <hi>Breda</hi> to old <hi>Courtney</hi> the Jeſuite, That you would follow the Directions that <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> had given you, and then you queſtion'd not but to bring the People to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Roman Catholick Religion.</hi> This, Sir, was your Project, and how you purſued it, let all the World judge. Therefore,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Your Conſpirators were reſolv'd to remove all thoſe who had been emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in Virtue and Sobriety from any Command or Place of Truſt in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. I muſt not forget the Uſage of thoſe who had been great Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in that Work, <hi>viz.</hi> Two thouſand Miniſters in one day laid aſide, that room might be made for thoſe whoſe Doctrine ſhould enſlave the People, and whoſe profligate Lives ſhould render Men Atheiſts enough to be of any Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but of that which was according to Godlineſs; <hi>Make them Atheiſts,</hi> ſaid <hi>Mazarine, aad you will ſoon make them Papiſts.</hi> Nay, the love of Debauchery created ſuch a Prejudice in your Brother the King, againſt the Marquiſs of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle,</hi> that it was the chief Obſtacle to his being pardon'd, for he had reprov'd <hi>Charles</hi> for offering Violence to a ſober Lady in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the year 1650, for which Reproof he never forgave <hi>Argyle</hi> to his dying day. Nay, give me leave to remember you, that when that unfortunate Lord was in Cuſtody, and humbly requeſted but to ſpeak one word with the King before he was carried for <hi>Scotland,</hi> to be murder'd, you took upon you to reprove any that ſhould move the King, with this Jeer. That <hi>Argyle</hi> was one of the Godly Party, it was not for ſuch fellows to ſee the King: Or to that purpoſe; and the King your
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56278:63"/>
Brother was pleas'd to ſay, <q>Let my Lord <hi>Argyle</hi> be content, he ſhall ſee the Maiden e're long, his own dearly beloved Invention.</q> And nothing was a greater Argument for his Deſtruction than his Piety.</p>
               <p>Sir, I can prove, that thoſe men who were concerned in Judging and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning your Father to death, tho' that was the Pretence or handle you took to have them cut off, yet the great reaſon why they were not ſpared was, that if they lived, and as long as they lived they would have been great Obſtacles in your way of debauching the People, and that was the reaſon of their being cut off; for old <hi>Courtney</hi> being at <hi>London,</hi> and admiring their demeanour and deportment in their Confinement, gave you an account of their Piety and Devotion. And ſo did old <hi>Hitchcock</hi> the Monk; but what Anſwer you made them was remarkable; your Brother and your ſelf would never have had them excepted, had you not been fully ſatisfied, that as long as they lived you could have no manner of proſpect of ſettling the Government, and advancing the Catholick Religion; both which have told me of their ſtedfaſtneſs and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the laſt degree, and could not forbear ſhedding of Tears when they diſcourſed that matter to me; and if you remember, it was the weaker part of thoſe men that had their Lives given them; not but that ſome of them were worthy perſons, but they had not arrived to thoſe Experiences of God and true Religion as the others had done, that laid down their Lives in that Cauſe. But the truth is, I never found many of them had ſo little Grace as to repent of what they had done.</p>
               <p>Nay, your Rage did not ceaſe here; for you, by all the Wrong imaginable, pack'd a Parliament together of greenheaded young Gentlemen, the Sons of ſome <hi>Cavaliers,</hi> whoſe Parents ſuffer'd in the late War, and ſo were haters of <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> from whom an Act was obtained to empower Commiſſioners to diſplace all Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers that they ſhould judge not to be firm to the King's Intereſt and Proceedings: By this Knack you had all Juſtices of the Peace, and Corporation Magiſtrates, that had been forward in puniſhing Prophaneneſs and Ungodlineſs in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Places, and had been great Promoters of Religion and Holineſs of Life, turn'd out, and in their rooms were put all profane and ungodly Wretches, Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers by, and Blaſphemers of the Name of Almighty God, theſe being Men for your Turn, that you might the more eaſily enſlave, and ſo pervert the People. And it was come to that paſs, that none could have any Employment unleſs he could ſwear and damn for the Church, tho' they never came within the inſide of one all their days. Of theſe, Sir, you made moſt excellent Papiſts in proceſs of time, or at leaſt Favourers of the Popiſh Party.</p>
               <p>Your Conſpirators had an Eye upon the City of <hi>London,</hi> and therefore, that none might ſtand in your way of debauching that City, all the ſober old Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Army was not to come within 20 miles of it. This was done by the Advice of your old Friends the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> who viſited all your ſoured <hi>Cavaliers,</hi> and your Conſpiring Villains, and never left urging to them the danger the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was in, till they were diſarm'd and baniſh'd <hi>London.</hi> 'Tis true, the great Argument was, the Safety of the Government; but the true one was, your making your progreſs in perverting the People to the <hi>Popiſh Religion;</hi> for all
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56278:64"/>
Virtue being diſcourag'd, both in Church and State, they had the fairer op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of proſelyting the prophaner part of Mankind to the Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, that ſome few that were ſober men had the fortune to be prefer'd both in Church and State; but what Joy you and your Conſpirators conceiv'd when they were remov'd either by Death or Age, is not forgotten. Thoſe Stateſmen that oppos'd Popery or Arbitrary Power were ſoon remov'd, and if they had the hap to dye in their Offices, they could do no more againſt Popery and Arbitrary Power than tell their Friends what Care you took to bring it in. But this I ſay, if any were but zealous, he was commonly laid aſide as uſeleſs and dangerous to the Government, for as long as they lived or continued in Power, you and your Party could not go on ſo ſmoothly in your Practices againſt our Religion, Laws and Liberties.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is well remember'd how your Conſpirators carried a Villanous Deſign of putting on Sham Plots upon Men, in order to take away their Lives and Eſtates, to the utter ruine of their Families and Poſterity for ever. Theſe were ſo many, that to enter into the Particulars of them would be enough to fill a Volume; but I will therefore reckon theſe that follow as the Chief of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If you pleaſe, I pray you, Sir, to call to mind the riſing of the <hi>Fifth-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy-men</hi> on the 6th of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1660/1. Who drew in thoſe men to that fooliſh and wicked Attempt but your old Acquaintance Dr. <hi>Goff,</hi> and <hi>Strange</hi> the Jeſuite, and <hi>Gray,</hi> and another Jeſuite that went by the name of St. <hi>George,</hi> and <hi>Aſhby,</hi> that was afterwards Rector at St. <hi>Omer</hi>'s, who counterfeited themſelves <hi>Fifth Monarchy-men?</hi> For an Uncle of mine, one Mr. <hi>Thomas Buttivant,</hi> was engag'd with them, and had been in the Riſing, if the Three hundred Horſe had come they promiſed ſhould joyn Fifteen hundred Foot; and this <hi>Buttivant</hi> was to have been Commander in chief of the Horſe: He was ſo intimately acquainted with this <hi>Gray,</hi> that they called Brothers; this <hi>Gray</hi> I having ſeen ſo often with that Uncle of mine, that when I came to be acquainted with the Jeſuits, notwithſtanding it was ſo many years after, I found this <hi>Gray</hi> to be a Jeſuite, who had pretended to <hi>Fifth Monarchy</hi> Principles; and renewing my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him, he told me, That he, and <hi>Strange,</hi> and others of the Society with this <hi>Goff,</hi> uſed to preach to them in <hi>Swan-Alley</hi> in <hi>Coleman-ſtreet,</hi> and at Mr. <hi>Buttivant</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Cobb</hi>'s <hi>Yard</hi> in <hi>Petticoat-lane,</hi> and that they had drawn in ſeveral of thoſe poor Dogs, as they termed them, to be hang'd, but they themſelves were protected by you at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and in <hi>Whitehall;</hi> and 'tis true, that <hi>Gray</hi> had the <hi>Fifth-Monarchy</hi> Notions to a Hairs-breadth. In this Affair the Society were at ſome Hundreds of pounds charge, for they were liberal of their Mony, and poſſeſſed theſe poor Creatures of your Brother's and your being <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and that your deſign was to deſtroy the Intereſt of Chriſt in the three Nations, and to ſet up <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery,</hi> and ſo drew them into that Folly of Riſing, and all with this intent, that they might obtain ſome ſevere Laws againſt the <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters,</hi> in order to weaken the <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt</hi> within theſe three Nations, and boaſted very much of your being privy to the whole Deſign:
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56278:64"/>
And, by your <hi>Carriage</hi> in other <hi>Affairs,</hi> you will be by all ſober <hi>Proteſtants</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed guilty of <hi>This.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againſt ſuch ſtrange Practices the poor <hi>Diſſenters</hi> did at that time, in their <hi>Addreſſes</hi> and <hi>Declarations</hi> to the Government, poſitively, without any Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or Mental Reſervation, declare and proteſt their abhorrence, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avowed all ſuch Principles as might tend to ſuch irregular and diſorderly Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as tending highly to the diſhonour of GOD and the Proteſtant Religion; yet you and your Jeſuites and Prieſts made great uſe of <hi>this,</hi> to beget a diſeſteem of them in the future Parliament.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another Conſpiracy was formed and contrived by you and your <hi>Banditti,</hi> againſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and this was in <hi>November</hi> 1661. A doubty Knight of your Friendſhip forged ſeveral Letters from ſeveral Miniſters of the Goſpel about <hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> and ſeveral other Counties; and in conjunction with this Villain ſeveral Jeſuites acted, amongſt whom was Father <hi>Fitz Patrick</hi> and Father <hi>Peter Talbot,</hi> afterwards the pretended Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and old <hi>Courtney;</hi> all of theſe were employ'd by your ſelf, as I have ſeen in ſeveral Letters, wherein they complained of your delaying their being ſatisfied for that Service: But the Intrigue did not hold Water, tho' ſeveral honeſt men ſuffer'd Impriſonment for the ſame. But the Forgers and Framers of this Helliſh Conſpiracy in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Plot had an aim at the rewarding Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> for the great Service he did in your Brother's Reſtauration and yours.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another of the ſame nature was invented by your Conſpirators in <hi>Oxford,</hi> wherein the Names of ſeveral men of note and value, to the number of above a Hundred, whoſe Lives were deſign'd to have been made Sacrifices to Hell and <hi>Rome;</hi> but neither did that Cheat take any other effect than to continue the then <hi>Parliament</hi> exaſperated againſt poor <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters,</hi> as men of reſtleſs Spirits, that were always diſturbing the Government. So that by theſe Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces you did not only find a way to throw them out of their Livings, but endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd their Lives alſo.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Your Prieſts and Jeſuites not making their <hi>Sham-Plots</hi> to hold upon the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> your Conſpirators try what they could do with two Pillars of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> one <hi>Hill</hi> and <hi>Riggs,</hi> both highly carreſs'd by three ſpecial Guardians of the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s Intereſt, that is, old <hi>Coſens,</hi> old <hi>Hinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and <hi>Sheldon,</hi> three of the Devil's Brokers. Theſe two Villains <hi>Hill</hi> and <hi>Riggs,</hi> both Parſons, they pretend to diſcover a <hi>Fanatick Plot,</hi> as they call'd it, againſt the <hi>King's, Yours,</hi> and old <hi>Monk</hi>'s and Turncoat <hi>Brown</hi>'s Lives, and this Plot was ſworn againſt ſeveral Honeſt Men, for which ſome loſt their Lives; the one got a preferment to a Living, and the other was preferred to eat Salt Beef and Pork and Peaſe at Sea, and ſometimes he acted as a <hi>Chaplain</hi> in a Ship, with great Promiſes of being preferred, but God cut him off, whilſt <hi>Hill</hi> ſlept in a Pocky Skin. Now, Sir, to lay open to you and the whole World the truth of this matter, I pray obſerve, that this <hi>Hill</hi> and this <hi>Riggs</hi> were in your Pay, to be Spies upon the Converſations of ſeveral Honeſt men, as <hi>Butler</hi> and <hi>Seely</hi> was afterwards in your Brothers for the ſame purpoſe; <hi>Riggs</hi> and <hi>Hill</hi> gets into the Company of ſeveral <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and in their hearing did talk at a ſtrange rate
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56278:65"/>
againſt the Government, and what a ſecret Cabal there was meeting in <hi>London</hi> for the change of the ſame; and how that the King your Brother and your ſelf were for introducing <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery.</hi> But to prevent your Attempts of that ſort, the ſaid <hi>Riggs</hi> and <hi>Hill</hi> told them, That Arms and Ammunition were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and that a number of honeſt men were left to riſe, and defend the true Religion, Laws, and Liberties of the Kingdom; and that <hi>Deale</hi> Caſtle and <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor</hi> Caſtle were to be ſurprized. This ſort of Talk they had with ſome few ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men, who in the Integrity of their Hearts confeſſed, that they heard <hi>Hill</hi> and <hi>Riggs</hi> talk at this rate. Nay, theſe Devils could not deny, but that they did uſe this ſort of talk, and intimated that they had a Licenſe ſo to do. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe poor Creatures denied that ever they had any hand in any ſuch Conſpiracy, nor indeed was any thing proved, but what <hi>Hill</hi> and <hi>Riggs</hi> ſwore they had talk'd to them, yet they were condemn'd and baſely murder'd, and their Families ruin'd by your procurement, and <hi>Hill</hi> and <hi>Riggs</hi> eſcaped with Impunity, tho' not without Infamy. Your Jeſuites would have courted them both to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but they appearing to be ſuch Rogues, they were afraid they would be a Diſgrace to them, who from their riſing up in the World had themſelves been a Scandal and Diſgrace to the Creation of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. You having ſome Succeſs in this, your Conſpirators would not be idle, but drew in ſome warm Men into another <hi>Conſpiracy</hi> in the North. The then Sheriff of the County of <hi>York,</hi> and a great man whoſe Name I will omit, becauſe he did in part afterwards make <hi>England</hi> ſome amends for that piece of Villany, you know, at that time, to pleaſe the Court, he was reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and no doubt, whilſt ſo, he was a fit Tool to carry on ſo wicked a Deſign, which was to diſcourſe of the Oppreſſion the Nation lay under thro' the Duties of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, &amp;c.</hi> and the diſturbance that the Lawyers had made in the Kingdom; That your Brother and you were bringing in of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery,</hi> at which theſe poor Creatures were enflam'd; and being promis'd the ſupply of Mony, and by the High Sheriff the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Poſſe Comitatus,</hi> they were drawn in to engage: But alas, it was but a <hi>Trappan,</hi> they were taken and executed upon the Evidence of ſome of them that were engaged with them; but how you rewarded that Perſon of Quality afterwards it is well-enough known. This was another of your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as the Perſon of Quality you employed hath told to ſeveral Friends with great Grief, ſome of whom are alive to this day.</p>
               <p>But not to forget one paſſage, let me tell you, that you and your Conſpirators made at the Tryal of Mr. <hi>Alured</hi> two Witneſſes of one Man; firſt he appear'd in a ſtrange diſguiſe, with one Eye, and gave his Teſtimony under one Name, and then withdrew, and appear'd in his common Dreſs, and gave his teſtimony by his own Name, and ſo <hi>Alured</hi> was murder'd by the Conſpirators. <hi>This</hi> can be prov'd by good teſtimony.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I will give you a ſhort Truth of the Fire of <hi>London,</hi> how that Eight Men were executed for having a deſign to fire the City of <hi>London</hi> on the third of <hi>September</hi> 1666. And great care was taken to lay it upon the <hi>Fifth-Monarchy-Men,</hi> and the old Officers of the Army that ſerved under the Parliament, but in truth it was contrived by your ſelf and your wicked <hi>Popiſh</hi> Party, and by you
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56278:65"/>
and them carried on to deſtroy that great <hi>Proteſtant City,</hi> that with more eaſe you and your Accomplices might introduce <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery</hi> among us; for <hi>London</hi> was the Bulwark of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> and <hi>Engliſh Liberties,</hi> and therefore ſhe muſt be made a Burnt-Offering to your ſelf and Helliſh <hi>Popiſh</hi> Crew.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Another Inſtance of your Conſpirators ſhamming their Plots upon poor innocent <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and that is the Caſe of the Lord <hi>Claypool,</hi> and by this caſt an Odium upon the whole body of <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters:</hi> For in the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> juſt about the time that your Conſpirators were to execute their wicked Deſign to deſtroy the King, then you deal with Secretary <hi>Coventry,</hi> to clap up that poor innocent Gentleman, for deſigning to ſeize the King as he went to <hi>Newmarket;</hi> and you had two Witneſſes ready at hand to have ſworn that Deſign againſt him the ſaid <hi>Claypool,</hi> who was by the Secretary's Warrant arreſted for High Treaſon: But he the ſaid <hi>Claypool</hi> knowing nothing of the matter, demanded to know his Accuſers; that was (according to that Villain's uſual way) deny'd him, and he frown'd upon as if he had been the greateſt Knave in <hi>England</hi> next to <hi>Coventry</hi> himſelf. <hi>Claypool</hi> was as ſtout as that Knave of a Secretary was proud and inſolent; and as for <hi>Claypool,</hi> he would ſcarce anſwer any Queſtion, ſo away he was ſent to the <hi>Tower</hi> a cloſe Priſoner. This ſtartled every one except the Conſpirators and my ſelf, who was privy to the whole buſineſs, by the repeated Orders <hi>Coleman</hi> receiv'd from, Sir, your ſelf, for his Proſecution, that when the Blow was given upon the King, it might be charg'd upon the <hi>Fanaticks:</hi> And to that end <hi>Sing</hi> and <hi>Throgmorton,</hi> two virulent Papiſts, and <hi>Butler</hi> and <hi>Seely,</hi> two Popiſh Spies of your Brother's and yours, both preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> the laſt, I think, is a <hi>Corniſh</hi> man, and was a Major in the late Protector's Army; ſo that you and all your Popiſh Conſpirators intended as one Man to revenge the Death of the King on the <hi>Diſſenting Party,</hi> concluding that the Vermin of the Church of <hi>England</hi> would ſtrike in with the <hi>Popiſh Party,</hi> ſince they hated a <hi>Diſſenter</hi> worſe than a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> tho' differing from them only in a few ſcoundrel Ceremonies not worthy to wipe a Porter's Tail withal: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as a Prologue to that curſed Deſign, you could not think of a man fitter than this Lord <hi>Claypool,</hi> he being Son-in-Law to that Lord Protector <hi>Cromwell;</hi> but you and your Villains were diſappointed for a time from deſtroying the King, for when the true Plot was diſcover'd, your deviliſh Witneſſes againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Party diſappear'd. And ſo much for <hi>Claypool.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Another Inſtance of your implacable Hatred to the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and of your deſigning to ſham a Plot upon them, was your old and very good Friend Mr. <hi>Thomas Blood,</hi> whom you and your Brother ſet upon my ſelf, to bring me into a Conſpiracy with <hi>Richard</hi> late Lord Protector, and him the ſaid <hi>Blood,</hi> to dethrone your Brother and your ſelf; which, Sir, was a great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, for your Crimes were ſo plain and notorious, that an honeſt man would have thought the Laws of the Land and publick Juſtice would have reach'd you both without ſuch irregular Methods as theſe were; but I diſcover'd the Letter, and the Trappan eſcap'd for a while, and then God cut him off with Infamy and Diſgrace.</p>

                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:56278:66"/>
9. I muſt entreat your patience to remember another Inſtance, and that is the particular Caſe of Mr. <hi>Thomas Dangerfield,</hi> who was maintained by you and your Conſpirators with Twelve pounds <hi>per</hi> week, to invent a Plot againſt the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> the better to colour or hide your own. What Papers you and the reſt of your Conſpirators contrived to be put upon the Duke of <hi>Buckingham!</hi> The Gentleman of his Horſe was <hi>Mansfield,</hi> and he was prepared to be a ſecond Witneſs againſt the ſaid Duke, as <hi>Dangerfield</hi> was ſuborned to be the firſt, ſo that you might have the Blood of that great man, as being one in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy to deſtroy the King your Brother. But <hi>Dangerfield</hi> had not been ſo mindful of his Leſſon as he ought, and fixeth himſelf upon one <hi>Manſel,</hi> who had been a Retainer to the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who at that time was carried away with the diſſimulation of the Popiſhly-affected Party, but inſtead of leaving them in <hi>Mansfield</hi>'s Chamber, left them in <hi>Manſel</hi>'s Chamber. In theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers there was a Liſt of Noblemen and Gentlemen that were to be ſworn againſt, as being in a Conſpiracy againſt the Life of the King your Brother, and your ſelf, and Church of <hi>England:</hi> And, to make the World believe that theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were not forged, this <hi>Dangerfield</hi> repairs to Secretary <hi>Coventry,</hi> your old League-breaker, and informs the Secretary (who was privy to the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern) of a dangerous Plot againſt the Government, and that there were dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Papers in the Chamber of Coll. <hi>Manſel,</hi> that would make the ſame out: but the fellow, tho' he had been a Rogue all his days, as God would have it, ſcrupl'd the Oath; tho' if he had ſaid in <hi>Mansfield</hi>'s Chamber, he ſhould have had a Warrant without an Oath; but mentioning the Name of <hi>Manſel,</hi> the Secretary was ſtartled, becauſe that <hi>Manſel</hi> was a Favourite of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> againſt whom this Conſpiracy was not at firſt to appear, therefore <hi>Coventry</hi> would do nothing without an Oath in relation to <hi>Manſel,</hi> becauſe of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who was then actually a Privy Councillor; therefore <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerfield</hi> was reſolv'd to have the papers brought to light, and therefore gets an Officer or Officers of the Cuſtomhouſe, to ſearch <hi>Manſel</hi>'s Chamber for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited Goods, and then theſe papers were ſeiz'd: And <hi>Manſel</hi> hearing of what was done when he came to his Lodging, and that papers of dangerous conſequence was found in his Chamber, behind his Beds-head, where he had never laid any, he immediately repairs to the Council, and complains of his uſage before <hi>Dangerfield</hi> had told his Story.</p>
               <p>Well then, what becomes of this Affair, ſo fooliſhly miſcarrying in its firſt birth? I muſt obſerve to you, that <hi>Dangerfield</hi> is called in queſtion; and tho' he had many Friends in the Council, and many that knew the Deſign well enough, yet the Blunder that <hi>Dangerfield</hi> made was ſo great, and his Story hung ſo ill together, that the Conſpirators that were at the Board began to be confounded, and were much dejected that their Tool had ſucceeded no better; for, beſides all his ſelf-contradictions, ſhrewd proofs were brought againſt him: Yet notwithſtanding the aforeſaid blunder, and his being ſo confronted with Major <hi>Richardſon</hi> and others, <hi>Dangerfield</hi> was as bold as his Folly was great, and ſtood in it, that the Papers taken in <hi>Manſel</hi>'s Lodgings were not put there by him, till at laſt the proof of the Cuſtomhouſe Officer that ſearched, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56278:66"/>
                  <hi>Dangerfield</hi>'s own words, the Cheat and the Roguery was moſt manifeſt; ſo that the Council, tho' many of them your Conſpirators and his intimate Friends, were of neceſſity obliged to commit him to <hi>Newgate,</hi> who being there, was ſtill upheld by that Whore <hi>Cellier,</hi> and the reſt of your Conſpirators, who had redeem'd him out of <hi>Newgate</hi> for this very end and purpoſe, and had forbad him to diſcover; but ſome Letters being diſcover'd, and he being out of all hopes, made his application to the then Lord Mayor to take his diſcovery; which was done, and upon that Diſcovery it plainly appear'd who ſet him on work to frame ſuch a piece of Villany. You were ſo nettl'd at the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, that inſtead of the Lord Mayor's having Thanks return'd him for his Service to the King and the Nation, that he met with a Check at Court for meddling in that which concerned him not. But by this Trick the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Eyes were open'd, and he fairly left you and the Council, abhorring ſuch Villanies as never was to be parallel'd in future, nor heard of in paſt Ages.</p>
               <p>Your <hi>Sham-Plot</hi> thus miſcarrying, and the Book found in the Meal-Tub, ſhewing who they were that was to be ſworn out of their Lives falſly, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you know, Sir, that you were, with your Accomplices, at a ſtand; for, Sir, you know that this Villany, if it had been placed with <hi>Mansfield,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Servant, who was to have been a ſecond Witneſs with <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> and both theſe to have been corroborated by <hi>Blood, Butler,</hi> and <hi>Seely,</hi> you would have cut off, by a Form of Juſtice, all ſuch perſons as had ſtood in oppoſition to your wicked Deſigns and Practices; ſo that a new Parliament ſhould have been open'd with the noiſe of a <hi>Presbyterian Plot,</hi> therefore you know the Parliament was prorogued for a longer time, and your ſelf forced to part with a ſmall Spell to get this thing done, and the French King preſſed for a bigger Seame, which was happily prevented by the Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. I muſt beg your Pardon if I put you in mind of another piece of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guery your reſtleſs Conſpirators undertook; For a new Parliament being to meet at <hi>Oxford,</hi> in the year 1680/1, they were reſolved to welcom that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament with a <hi>Proteſtant Plot</hi> in good earneſt, to the end with more eaſe you might bring your curſed Deſigns to paſs. In order to this, it was agreed by your Crew, that Papers containing Treaſonable Matters ſhould be got to be written, and lodg'd in the Houſes of private men, and ſhuffled into Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen's Pockets at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and before the meeting of the Parliament they ſhould be ſeiz'd with ſuch Papers about them; and one <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> who was to be their Tool, was well acquainted with one <hi>Everard,</hi> that was a Villain much of the ſaid <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>'s ſtature or ſtandard; for it was a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to know which was the greateſt of the two. This <hi>Everard</hi> had been countenanc'd by the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and therefore the ſaid <hi>Everard</hi> was judg'd the moſt fit to joyn with him in the Roguery: And <hi>Everard</hi> had agreed with this <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> to be ſeized with theſe Papers about him, when they had diſperſed as many of them as would do the buſineſs; but thoſe that employ'd theſe <hi>Raſcals</hi> in this <hi>affair</hi> were ſuch, that it would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> with Confuſion to name them. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> had his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from your Brother and <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and when Acceſs could not be had to them, then they received them from <hi>Nell Wall,</hi> a notorious Whore, that from a poor Wench that waſhed down the Stairs, was made her Miſtreſſes Woman, and privy to the whole Intrigue.</p>
               <p>The Writing was drawn up, and much approved by the King your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Dutcheſs, and their Approbation ſignified to this <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> by this Whore <hi>Nell Wall,</hi> and the ſame told to this <hi>Everard</hi> by <hi>Fitz-Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris;</hi> but no Mony conſiderable appearing, unleſs it were one Thirty pound, <hi>Everard</hi> diſcovers this Intrigue to one <hi>Smith,</hi> commonly call'd <hi>Narrative Smith,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Waller.</hi> They are planted in a ſecret Room, where they might not only hear, but ſee the Tranſactions between <hi>Everard</hi> and this <hi>Fitz-Harris;</hi> ſo that <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was apprehended and committed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Everard</hi>'s Teſtimony, and Try'd and Condemn'd upon the Teſtmony of <hi>Smith,</hi> and <hi>Waller,</hi> and <hi>Everard,</hi> and fairly Hang'd, that he might not tell Tales. So <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> and ſeveral others eſcaped that one time from being made a Sacrifice to your Will and Pleaſure. The Story, Sir, is too long to be fully repeated, but when any of your Curſed Crew ſhall Anſwer <hi>this,</hi> I ſhall tell the whole Story at length; but this ſhall ſuffice for this Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Be pleas'd to remember how many <hi>Iriſh men</hi> were ſuborned to ſwear againſt the Life of the ſaid Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and how diligent your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators were to ſuborn others that were of the ſame ſtamp for Roguery and Villany; but God, by the Induſtry and Care of his Friends, deliver'd him; and what theſe Villains ſwore againſt him was ſo inconſiſtent with either the Principles or declared Judgment of that Noble Lord, and the Particulars of their Teſtimony ſo contradictory one to the other, that the Grand Jury would not return a <hi>billa ver a</hi> upon the Teſtimony of theſe Rogues, tho' the Court uſed all the indirect methods with that Jury to have the Bill found.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Sir, I muſt deal plainly with you and your Tribe, that my Heart is ready to bleed when I muſt name to you the Murther of the Earl of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex,</hi> whoſe Throat you procured to be cut that very Morning, that a Way might be made for the Horrible Murther of the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> who was by your means baſely murder'd by a Form of Law; and the great Collonel <hi>Sidney,</hi> what Juries of Common Rogues and Villains were pack'd upon them by the contrivance of murdering <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>North,</hi> your two pretended She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex,</hi> Fellows that valued not the Blood of a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,</hi> but rejoyced that they had made you and your Conſpirators drunk with their Blood!</p>
               <p>I muſt not forget poor <hi>Stephen Colledge,</hi> who was baſely murder'd at <hi>Oxford</hi> by a Sett of wicked Judges, and a Pack'd Jury, at <hi>Oxford,</hi> whoſe Blood cries to Heaven for Vengeance againſt you and your Cut-throat Party.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:56278:67"/>
We have a Cloud of Inſtances againſt you and your Party of your ſuborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Witneſſes againſt Mr. <hi>Colt,</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> Sir <hi>Samuel Barnadiſton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Covet,</hi> Mr. <hi>Culliford,</hi> Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Pilkington,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> my ſelf and others; what a long and tedious Impriſonment we all ſuffer'd through the Teſtimony of your ſuborned and perjur'd Witneſſes. But this may ſuffice for this ſecond Particular, how you and your Conſpirators, from the very time of your being reſtor'd to your Native Country, which was in the year 1660, to the year 1685, that you took the Crown.</p>
               <p>III. A third Project that you and your Popiſh Crew had on foot was, to ruine our Trade. It was not enough that you fired our Cities, and abuſed the Profeſſors of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> by the many Murders that were by you and your Party committed, by the help of your Mercenary Judges and Hackney Jury-men, but you alſo labour'd heartily to diſturb the Trade of the Nation, that you might with more eaſe enſlave it, and bring in <hi>Popery</hi> upon us. I will but give you only one or two Inſtances; Many might be given, to your Shame, and the Shame of your Party, if there was any ſuch thing remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt Inſtance I ſhall give you is the countenancing the French King to take ſo many of our Merchants Ships by his Pyrates and Rovers in our Seas; and ſeveral Letters were written by your Secretary Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> to Sir <hi>Ellys Leyton,</hi> wherein ſeveral Merchantmen, whoſe Owners and Merchants had been obnoxious to you or your Party, by oppoſing <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery;</hi> he was by your eſpecial Order to ſee their Ships and Goods condemned, to the utter undoing of ſeveral Families. And your Servant <hi>Coleman,</hi> when any thing of a Tradeſman was mentioned, he uſed to ſay, <hi>Damn them, they are a ſort of Fanaticks that have no Kindneſs for my Maſter, or our Religion, and it will be never well till we make them poor, then they will be brought to obey.</hi> Nay, Sir, this was your Language too, or elſe you would never have been ſo much of the Opinion of the French King, your <hi>moſt Chriſtian</hi> Brother.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond Inſtance is taken from the Letters that were written to the Rector of St. <hi>Omers, Richard Aſhby,</hi> from <hi>Thomas White</hi> and <hi>John Keines,</hi> and others of the Society in <hi>London,</hi> in which Letters from them and others were encloſed Letters to <hi>Thomas Stapletoa,</hi> then Procurator at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> to perſwade the Father Confeſſor of Duke <hi>de Villa Hermoſa,</hi> then Governor of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> to inform him the ſaid Duke, That the King your Brother did not intend to aſſiſt the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> but would ſtand a looker on till he was ruin'd by the French King. Which Letter being not ſealed, I ſaw it; and that in caſe the Father Confeſſor to the ſaid Governor ſhould not be ready to comply with the ſaid <hi>Stapleton,</hi> that Meſſengers ſhould be forthwith ſent to Father <hi>Swiman</hi> at <hi>Madrid,</hi> to inform the King of <hi>Spain</hi> of the ſaid Concern, and to make the ſame relation of the buſineſs to the Popiſh Archbiſhop of <hi>Tuam,</hi> of the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who was then at the Court at <hi>Madrid,</hi> that he the ſaid <hi>Swiman</hi> and the ſaid Titular Archbiſhop, might jointly give
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56278:68"/>
an account of the Motion made or to be made to the ſaid Father Confeſſor of Duke <hi>de Villa Hermoſa,</hi> and alſo to adviſe the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King to ſeize the Eſtates of the Engliſh Merchants in their ſeveral Factories in his Dominions, for that they had endeavour'd to tranſport their Eſtates, and did tranſport them to <hi>England,</hi> and all, or moſt part, in the Coin of <hi>Spain,</hi> to the great Prejudice of the Kingdom of <hi>Spain.</hi> And for the confirmation thereof, they procur'd Letters from one <hi>Fonſeca,</hi> ſometimes an Agent in <hi>London,</hi> to atteſt the ſame, this <hi>Fonſeca</hi> willingly complying with your Conſpirators, and ſent his Letter to St. <hi>Omer</hi>'s, that the Fathers there might give their Approbation to the ſaid Letter, in order to be ſent to the Court of <hi>Spain;</hi> which Letter was long and large, Atteſtations therein made againſt the Merchants of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Factories concerning the Matter of Fact before mentioned, and other Letters were diſpatch'd to <hi>Daniel Armſtrong</hi> at <hi>Valladolyd,</hi> and <hi>John Croſs</hi> then at <hi>Madrid,</hi> in which they were order'd to confirm this Atteſtation made or to be made by the Fathers in <hi>England,</hi> and of the Engliſh Seminary at St. <hi>Omer</hi>'s, and of the ſaid <hi>Stapleton,</hi> together with that of the ſaid <hi>Fonſeca,</hi> the abovenamed <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Agent, who then lived at <hi>Bruges</hi> in <hi>Flanders.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In this Villanous Contrivance to diſturb the Nation in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Trade, your Servant <hi>Coleman</hi> was very active in your Name, and on your behalf, and engaged that your Letter to <hi>Villa Hermoſa</hi> ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is well known that your Brother and your ſelf were ſo engag'd with the French King that it was all one to you what became of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Concerns in <hi>Flanders;</hi> but you were both grieved to ſee the Engliſh Nation enrich'd with the Trade it had with <hi>Spain;</hi> for, during the time of the Riches and Plenty of <hi>England,</hi> it would be very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for you and your Conſpirators to bring in Popery and Slavery upon us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What Agents you make uſe of to carry on this Wicked Deſign to ruine Trade! Even <hi>Fonſeca,</hi> that hated the Engliſh Nation, and much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied her Greatneſs, and that ſhe might be in a condition to be brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the French Yoke, you tamper with him, that tho' a <hi>Spaniard</hi> by Nation, yet he was wholly in the French Intereſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third Inſtance that I ſhall remember you of, by which you intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ruine our Trade, and that was in the adulterating, debaſing and clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Coin of this Kingdom. It may be ſaid by you and your Partiſans, That it is very hard you ſhould be charged with this vile Act; but, Sir, it can be prov'd, that the Merchants, Goldſmiths, Brokers, Bankers, and the other Traders that the Jeſuites dealt with, all was by your Advice and Direction, and that your Servant <hi>Coleman</hi> had in your Name promiſed them the management of the Mint: So that your Conſpirators were to be the Judges of good and bad Mony, and were to manage the ſame to the beſt
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56278:68"/>
advantage for your Cauſe, and ſeveral Materials for Coining was provided by <hi>Smith</hi> your Agent, and lodged at Mr. <hi>Longhorn</hi>'s Chambers in the <hi>Temple.</hi> And this, Sir, I muſt obſerve to you for publick Good, that there hath been few or none that ever hath been executed but hath been of your Religion or Intereſt. That our Mony hath been abuſed is notorious. And all this you did in order to impoveriſh the Kingdom, and deſtroy its Trade.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A fourth Inſtance of you and your Traytors to diſturb the Trade of the Kingdom, was the Fire of <hi>London.</hi> I have treated of that already. As it was the Habitation for ſeveral Thouſands of good Proteſtants, that ſtood in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery;</hi> and as by the deſtroying this City you endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to weaken the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Intereſt, ſo now give me leave to tell you, it was with this deſign, to ruine the Trade of the Nation; for you know, that <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> was the Metropolis and Fountain of Trade, and when ſhe was deſtroy'd you could not but conclude, that the Trade muſt be diſturbed (with which the other parts of the Kingdom were made happy) through the great devaſtation that the Fire, that was carried on by your Wicked Inſtruments, had made.</p>
               <p>IV. A fourth Project that you had to accompliſh your Wicked Deſigns, was the Attempt of maintaining of a ſtanding Army, contrary to the Laws and Liberties of <hi>England</hi> in the times of Peace, and labour'd that point much with the King your Brother, to lay down the legal Force of this Kingdom <hi>(viz.</hi> the Militia) as uſeleſs to the Government; and therefore you and your Party advis'd him to lay them down, and to have Forces in every County un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Pay, and they were to be your Conſervators of the Peace. And, Sir, had the Revenue of the Crown been able to have born the Charge, you your ſelf projected a ſtanding Army, to keep the People in due Obedience. Now, what that due Obedience was, I ſhall not need to explain to you, for it was a ſtanding Army <hi>alamode de France;</hi> nay, they were to have the Power of the Civil Watch in the Night, which you ſaid would excuſe many ancient uſeleſs Men from that Service. And for the accompliſhment of your wicked Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, you advis'd, that the greater part of the Army ſhould conſiſt of French and Iriſh, and that the Officers of this Army ſhould conſiſt of as many <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> as could well be gotten to ſerve in that Army, and you had ſeveral of that ſort of Cattel that you kept in half-pay, in readineſs whenever your Brother ſhould have agreed to your Advice. It was not for want of Good will, but for want of Mony, that your Deſign did not then take.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A fifth Project that you had on foot to enſlave the Nation, and that was, the adviſing and contriving with your damnable Conſpirators the ſeizure of the Charters, Franchiſes, and Liberties of the Cities, Towns, and ancient Corporations of the Kingdom. It was, Sir, your ſelf and your Conſpirators that invaded the Privileges, and ſeized on the Charters of moſt of the Towns that had a Right to be repreſented by their Burgeſſes in Parliament, and by over awing ſome of them, you procur'd Surrenders of them to be made
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56278:69"/>
to the King your Brother, by which the Magiſtrates deliver'd up all their Rights and Privileges, to be diſpos'd of at his pleaſure, and the pleaſure of your ſelf and Conſpirators. Upon this you procur'd new Magiſtrates to be placed in thoſe Places as would carry on your wicked deſigns and purpoſes of advancing Popery and Slavery.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It was your Advice, together with your Conſpirators, that put the late King your Brother to turn out of the Commiſſion of the Peace and the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancy of the Counties, all ſuch who had been zealous for the defence of the Proteſtant Religion and Liberty, and had appear'd vigorouſly againſt Popery and Arbitrary Power, as perſons diſaffected to the Government both in Church and State, and repreſented them as Fanaticks, and Favourers of ſuch; by which means you got in Men of Villanous Morals, and ſuch heartily joyned in with your Conſpirators, to ruine the Proteſtant Intereſt, and to overthrow the Laws and Liberties of <hi>England.</hi> This was done in the year 1679.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Notwithſtanding ſome of your Conſpirators repreſented you as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whoſe Judgment was for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> yet becauſe the Proteſtant Diſſenters appear'd earneſtly in the aſſerting the Laws and Liberties of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and gave Countenance to the Diſcovery of the <hi>Popiſh Plot</hi> to, King <hi>Charles</hi> your Brother, who was in it in every <hi>part</hi> and <hi>particular</hi> thereof, excepting that of his own Murther; you and your Conſpirators ſtirred up that King to raiſe a terrible Perſecution againſt thoſe men, by which means you were the ruine of ſome Thouſands of Families, who by the ſeverity of the ſaid Perſecution were reduced almoſt to Beggery, or to live upon the Charity of Friends. Some were forced to fly the Nation, and yet were more loyal under their Preſſures and Provocations than your Cut-throat Papiſts were under their then Careſſes and Favours received from your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and your ſelf. Nay, a reverend Miniſter of the Goſpel of Chriſt, who had been very inſtrumental in your Reſtauration, yea, and ventur'd his Life for your Brother's Reſtauration, in the year 1650, you ſuffer'd to periſh in <hi>Newgate,</hi> as a Reward for ſo great a piece of Service to your Brother and your ſelf and Family; and for no other reaſon, but becauſe he could not comply with ſome <hi>Raſcally</hi> Ceremonies that our <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Vermin</hi> had borrow'd from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to Adorn our <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Worſhip, and becauſe he would not take the <hi>Oxford</hi> Oath, lay'd upon the Nation to enſlave it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Another Project you had for the ruining the Intereſt of the Proteſtant Religion, and the Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> was the Advancing of Men that were Enemies to the Proteſtant Intereſt into the greateſt Places of Truſt. As, What a Sett of Villains had you made Judges of the Land, by which means you brought all the Matters of Civil Juſtice into great Uncertainties, by reaſon of the Tenour of their Commiſſions, and the Ignorance of the Rogues you employ'd! Therefore how miſerable was the Nation, who were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to Anſwer to ſuch Judges that were forced to comply in all things
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56278:69"/>
with the Directions that were given by you and your Wicked Cut-throats, or elſe to be turned out at yours and their Pleaſure?</p>
               <p>If we look further, you had, in your Brother's time, the diſpoſing of all Military Employments; And how you did ſhew your Hatred to the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt! You did in his time raiſe a great many Perſons to the greateſt Military Truſts both by <hi>Sea</hi> and <hi>Land,</hi> Strangers as well as Natives; ſo that by theſe meaſures your Conſpirators became Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Affairs of the Government of the Nation, and of the courſe of Juſtice; and you had all the Church Vermin engag'd with you to ſubject the whole Kingdom to a deſpotick Arbitrary power; and all theſe joyn'd together to execute your wicked Deſigns, to enſlave and debauch the People of the Land.</p>
               <p n="9">9. To compleat the Work, that nothing might ſtand in your way of Eſtabliſhing your Popiſh Religion, you murder'd your Brother, who was uncertain in his Engagements in the Conſpiracy; for, when he found it was not ſafe for him to appear in promoting Popery, he ſoon left you. Or if a Sum of Money could be gotten from a <hi>Parliament,</hi> he commonly bleſs'd the Nation with a Proclamation or two againſt Popiſh Prieſts, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, and Popiſh Recuſants, or paſs a Bill or ſo to the prejudice of the Popiſh Party; as he did in 1673, when the Teſt-Bill paſſed; as alſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in 1678. This obliged you and your Conſpirators to haſten his deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which you had long contrived. You found a fit Tool, and as fit a Doſe to do the Work; in it you had your deſired Ends, and ſo you moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Throne. Which brings me to the Second Point, <hi>What you did in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Ruine of the</hi> Proteſtant Religion <hi>and the</hi> Government <hi>after your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to the Crown.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. Your Tyranny was very cruel, but ſhort, yet full of ſtrange and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing Circumſtances: It was highly aſtoniſhing to ſee a Popiſh Prince aſcending the Throne, to rule a Proteſtant Nation, and defend a Proteſtant Church; but, Sir, you had no ſuch Deſigns in your Head, for you ſhew'd what you would do with our Laws, when you could engage your Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators to diſpenſe with part of the Oaths that you ſhould have taken. It is manifeſt and notorious, that when you were upon the coming to the Crown you was receiv'd by all the People of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> as King, without the leaſt oppoſition, for our Eccleſiaſtical Vermin had made your way clear by their Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> and <hi>Non-Reſiſtance,</hi> and the Divine Right of Succeſſion, and the poſſibility of preſerving the Glory and Grandeur of their Church of <hi>England</hi> by a Popiſh Prince, and that there was more danger from <hi>Fanaticks</hi> than from <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and ſuch-like ſcoundrel Notions.</p>
               <p>You cannot but remember, that King <hi>Charles</hi> your Brother, having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the deadly Doſe your Conſpirators had prepar'd for him, on <hi>February</hi> the 6th, 1684/5, he went to his Place; that very day, Sir, you were proclaim'd
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56278:70"/>
King, to the ſorrow of all that wiſh'd well to <hi>England,</hi> and its Religion, Liberties and Laws: you then appear'd at the Council-Table as King, and by all your Conſpirators you was owned and ſaluted as ſuch, to whom you were pleas'd to make a ſort of a Speech, in which you were pleas'd to declare your ſelf to this effect.</p>
               <p>THat <hi>Since it hath pleaſed Almighty God to place you in that ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that you were now to ſucceed ſo Good and Gracious a King, as well as ſo Kind a Brother, you thought it fit to declare, That you would follow his Example, and more eſpecially in that of his great Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency and Tenderneſs to all his People: That you had been reported to have been a man for Arbitrary Power, tho' that had not been the only Story that had been made of you: That you would make it your Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to preſerve Government both in Church and State, as it was by Law eſtabliſh'd: That you knew the Principles of the Church of</hi> England <hi>were for Monarchy, and that the Members of it had ſhewn themſelves good and loyal Subjects, and therefore you would take care to defend and ſupport it: That you knew the Laws of</hi> England <hi>were ſufficient to make the King as great a Monarch as you could wiſh; and therefore, as you would never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the Juſt Rights and Prerogatives of the Crown, ſo you would never invade any Man's Property: And that you had ventur'd your Life very often in the defence of the Nation: And that you would go as far as any Man in preſerving it in all its Juſt Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, Sir, is the ſum and ſubſtance of what you were pleas'd to ſay at the Council board; and one would have ſworn that you would have taken up the Trade of being Speech wright-general to the whole Band of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators. I am confident your old Friends the Jeſuites, that had been hang'd but a little before, could not have outdone you, though it had been to have ſaved their Lives. Well, it was a Speech, and how true you were to this Speech you ſhall judge, and your Conſpirators too, if you will but conſider.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You ſaid, <hi>You would not invade any man's Right and Property, and that you would preſerve the Nation in its Juſt Rights and Liberties.</hi> And ſo you did, for you, the next day after your acceſſion to the Crown, publiſh'd a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation for the continuing the payment of the Cuſtom and Exciſe, which were expir'd by the death of the King your Brother for ſeveral weeks after. Did not this ſhew you to be a man for Arbitrary Power, to invade the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of a great part of the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> by your Proclamation; what Value you had for the Rights of the Nation, for whom you had ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56278:70"/>
your Life in a Coiled Cable; and what Regard you had to its Laws, that at your firſt ſtep in your pretended Government you bring in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation equivalent to thoſe Laws that expir'd as aforeſaid, by which the Exciſe and Cuſtoms in the time of the Reign of your kind and loving Brother had been ſetled and paid.</p>
               <p n="3">2. You ſaid, That <hi>you would follow the Example of your Brother, in his Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Tenderneſs to the People of</hi> England. What your <hi>Brother</hi>'s Clemency and Tenderneſs to the people of <hi>England</hi> was, I am yet to learn. What was his Clemency to his old Cavaliers, that had ſerv'd both his Father and him in the Wars, to the ruine of themſelves and Families, ſpending their Subſtance in both their Services, and not ſo much as looked upon when you were reſtor'd? After that Sir <hi>John Webſter,</hi> a Merchant, had lent him 150000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling, did not he, after much Importunity, reward the ſaid Sir <hi>John</hi> with the refuſal of a <hi>Land-waiter</hi>'s Place, and graciouſly ſuffer'd the poor man to ſtarve, as a Reward of his Loyalty? Was not his Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſuch, that within the compaſs of a very few years all his whole Intereſt was melted down into a ſmall Regiment of Pimps, Whores, and Bawds, on whom he laviſhly confer'd great Honours, and on them he profuſely ſpent the Treaſure of the Nation.</p>
               <p>Remember, Sir, how his Clemency was extended to thoſe Miniſters that brought him home, and to that Party of Men that reſtor'd him to his Crown and Dignity. Mr. <hi>Jenkins</hi> is a notable Inſtance of his Clemency, who ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd his Life for his Reſtoration, in that Cauſe that Mr. <hi>Love</hi> loſt his. What a Tenderneſs he had for Mr. <hi>Jenkins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> was ſeen in his murdering him in Priſon, notwithſtanding all the humble application made to your tender Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for his releaſe, in order to preſerve his Life.</p>
               <p>His Clemency to Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> was admirable, for rather than <hi>Vane</hi> ſhould not be ſent to Heaven, he broke through an Act of Parliament, leſt the Martyr ſhould find delay in his paſſage thither. What can you ſay of his Clemency to Great <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and Noble <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> whom he baſely and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly murder'd? I think that Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> is another Inſtance of his Clemency. And ſo you were as good as your word, in following the Example of his Clemency and Tenderneſs to the People of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For upon your entering into the Regal State, you let <hi>England</hi> have a taſte of your Clemency. I muſt begin with my own Caſe; I ſufficiently taſted of your Grace and Favour after that with the hazard of my Life; I had diſcover'd a <hi>Damnable Conſpiracy,</hi> carried on by the <hi>Popiſh Party,</hi> for the deſtruction of the King your Brother and the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Nation; how you uſed me let all the World judge, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Credit the <hi>Parliament</hi> had given me; as you may rememem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the Vote of <hi>March</hi> 15. 1679.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſolved,</hi> Nemine Contradicente, <hi>by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons in Parliament aſſembled, That they do declare that they are fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:56278:71"/>
                  <hi>by the Proofs they have heard, that there now is, and for divers years laſt paſt hath been, an Horrid and Treaſonable Plot and Conſpiracy, continued and carried on by thoſe of the Popiſh Religion, for the murdering of His Majeſty's Sacred Perſon, and for ſubverting the Proteſtant Religion, and the Ancient Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd Government of this Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all your Clemency and Tenderneſs to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, produce ſuch a Vote for the Juſtifying your Reputation in the Nation, and for ought I know, you may perſwade your ſelf that the Nation may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to receive you into favour again, and admit your tender Government of them once more.</p>
               <p>But to return to the Point. Notwithſtanding the Power of Truth and the Credit of this Vote, with what implacable Malice did you and your <hi>Banditti</hi> purſue me? How often did you attempt to take away my Life by the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Falſe Witneſſes? With what Importunity did you prevail upon the King your Brother to withdraw that Protection and Subſiſtance that the ſaid King allow'd me at the requeſt of ſeveral <hi>Parliaments,</hi> ſo that I might ſtarve for want of <hi>Bread?</hi> Nay, to expreſs your Clemency and Tenderneſs, how warmly did you proſecute me in an Action of <hi>Scandalum Magnatum,</hi> for ſpeaking this Notorious Truth of you, That you were reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that it was High Treaſon to be ſo reconcil'd? And what a noble Verdict a pack'd Jury of your Conſpirators, upon the proſecution, brought in againſt me, of One hundred thouſand Pound <hi>Damages?</hi> And thereupon you generouſly Charged me in Execution in the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> Priſon.</p>
               <p>And was you <hi>afraid</hi> that I was Able to have paid the Debt and Charges, and as Willing as Able? Well, to prevent it, you reſolv'd that I ſhould not want your Clemency and Tenderneſs; you therefore, to juſtifie thoſe Vertues to be inherent in you, you prevail'd with King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second to give you and your Conſpirators Leave to prefer two ſeveral Indictments of two pretended <hi>Perjuries</hi> in my Evidence concerning the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> but your Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains would not let the King your Brother live to ſee thoſe Indictments try'd, therefore they were brought to tryal in your tender Reign. What ſort of Witneſſes did you produce againſt me, but thoſe very men that had been in no leſs than three Tryals prov'd and judg'd to be Falſe Witneſſes, the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion they profeſſed no ways admitting them to be Credible; and therefore, as they were not believ'd when they gave their Teſtimony without an <hi>Oath,</hi> ſo they were not to be believ'd when they were upon their <hi>Oaths;</hi> for you know, tender Sir, they were of a Religion that could diſpenſe with <hi>Oaths,</hi> tho' falſe, for the ſake of your Catholick Cauſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe, Sir, were your Witneſſes; and you had two Juries of Men that had as large a Faith to believe as the Rogues had Conſciences to ſwear, and ſo I muſt averr <hi>Juries</hi> and <hi>Witneſſes</hi> to be alike, for he is as criminal, and is as much damn'd, that believes a Lye, as he is that makes one and ſwears it too; for the Rogues your mercenary wicked Judges, and the Villains that were Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and your pack'd Hell-born Jury-men, were all in (as it were) a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy, to be reveng'd on me for the diſcovery of the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> and to caſt a
<pb facs="tcp:56278:71"/>
Reproach upon the Wiſdom and Honour of four ſucceſſive Parliaments, and upon the publick Juſtice of the Nation.</p>
               <p>Well, Sir, I was convicted, notwithſtanding the Witneſſes I brought in, who were brow-beaten, abuſed by that Villain <hi>Jefferies,</hi> who had neither Law nor Sence, nor Manners, but had the Impudence of Ten Carted Whores; therefore nothing now remained for me but Judgment, which was your own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with the Advice of your twelve Villains that were of the Lambskin Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and others of your Conſpirators, as a Mark of your Clemency and Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards me. The Sentence was as barbarous and inhuman as it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt; for I was to pay to you Two thouſand Marks, to be diveſted of my Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Habit, and brought into <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> with a Paper upon my Head with this Inſcription; <hi>Titus Dates, convicted upon full Evidence of two Horrid Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; to ſtand in and upon the Pillory for two ſeveral days; on</hi> Wedneſday <hi>to be Whip'd from</hi> Aldgate <hi>to</hi> Newgate, <hi>and on the</hi> Friday <hi>following from</hi> Newgate <hi>to</hi> Tyburn; <hi>and to ſtand in and upon the Pillory five times every year of my Life, and to remain a Priſoner during Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Sentence ſounded ill in the Ears of moſt Men, and filled many with Horror and Amazement, when they conſider'd the great Clemency and Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that you did in your Speech but a little before mention to the Council, and therefore ſome perſons of known worth and quality made application to you to mitigate the Sentence, but were refus'd with the gracious Saying, <hi>That I ſhould go through it if I had breath in my body.</hi> And then, judging that your <hi>Italian</hi> Comrade might have this Clemency and Tenderneſs of yours under her Lock and Key, application was made to her Ladiſhip, but they found that ſhe was reſolv'd upon my Deſtruction; they return'd home, holding up their Eyes and Hands to Heaven with a <hi>Lord have Mercy upon us.</hi> Truly, Sir, it was their Good-will to me, but it was their Inadvertency to make any Application to you or your <hi>Italian Pugg;</hi> for it was the Example of your Brother's Clemency and Tenderneſs that you were reſolv'd to follow.</p>
               <p>Since it was ſo, not only I, but all thinking men, did then judge that your unparallel'd Sentence thus pronounc'd was to murder me; and therefore to juſtifie the inherent Clemency and Tenderneſs that you had for a poor <hi>Engliſh Proteſtant,</hi> the ſaid Sentence was executed with all the Circumſtances of Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, for I ſuffer'd ſome thouſands of Stripes, by which I was put to unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tortures, and lay ten weeks under the Chyrurgeons hands. But, Sir, your Malice and Malicious Clemency and Barbarous Tenderneſs did not ceaſe here; but becauſe I, thro' the great Mercy of Almighty God ſupporting me, and the extraordinary Care and Skill of a Judicious Chyrurgeon, outliv'd your Cruelty; for ſuch were your tender Mercies to me, you ſent ſome of your Cut-throat Crew, whilſt I was weak in my Bed, to pull off thoſe Plaiſters applied to cure my Back, and in your moſt gracious Name they threatned me with all Courteſie and Humanity to deſtroy me.</p>
               <p>Surely, Sir, a Man would have thought that by this time you had given Teſtimony enough of your Tenderneſs and Clemency, but I found to my Coſt that I was to taſte a little more of your Grace and Mercy; for by your own Command I was loaded with Irons of exceſſive weight, for the ſpace of one whole year without any intermiſſion, and of your Princely Compaſſion they
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56278:72"/>
were not ſuffer'd to be taken off even when my Legs were ſwoln with the <hi>Gout.</hi> Nay, that I might appear to partake of the utmoſt of your Mercy, I was by your order ſhut up in the Hole or Dungeon of the Priſon, whereby I became impair'd of my Limbs, and contracted <hi>Convulſion Fits,</hi> to the hazard of my Life. But when you had fill'd up the meaſure of your Sins, and the Nation came to its ſelf, you were by the juſt Judgment of God driven out of the Kingdom, and a Parliament freely choſen did ſit, obſerve the Judgment they made of your Grace and Clemency and Tenderneſs; in order to which read the Vote of the Houſe of Commons <hi>June</hi> 11. 1689. which was this; <hi>Reſolved, That the Proſecution of</hi> Titus Oates, <hi>upon two Indictments of Perjury, in the Court of</hi> King's Bench, <hi>was a Deſign to ſtifle the Popiſh Plot; and that the Verdicts given thereupon were corrupt; and that the Judgments given thereupon were cruel and illegal.</hi> Do you get ſuch another Vote to juſtifie your Clemency and Tenderneſs, we will keep a Day for you, tho' through the Bleſſing of God we may never ſee your Face again; but if we ſhould, give me leave to tell you, that the old Window of the <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting Houſe</hi> ſtands in the ſame place where it did you know when. But leſt you or any of your curſed Crew ſhould ſay, That altho' I taſted not of your Grace, and Clemency, and Tenderneſs, yet ſtill your Clemency did appear to others that had offended you, this makes me haſten to ſome other Inſtances wherein the World may judge whether or no your <hi>Tender Mercies</hi> were not <hi>Cruelty</hi> in the higheſt degree.</p>
               <p>2. Give me leave therefore to inſtance to you of the Uſage of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and thoſe Men that were with him in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> who did ryſe to have deliver'd the Nation from your Deſigns of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery,</hi> which you had for ſo many years with your Cut-throats carried on with ſuch Succeſs. That Noble Duke was your kind and loving Brother's Son, and your own Nephew, and one that for many years together had been very obſequious to you, and was, tho' ignorantly, in the Conſpiracy with you to ruine the Nation, and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd his Life in that wicked War againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> to oblige you and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but God had no ſooner open'd his Eyes, to make a true Judgment of your wicked purpoſes, but you ſought his Ruine, and took all Opportunities to be reveng'd upon him and his Party, which, you know, once was very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And when God deliver'd him into your hand, you were pleas'd upon <hi>Tower-hill</hi> to murder him. This I ſay becauſe that he being a Peer of the Realm, notwithſtanding his pretended Attainder, he ought to have had the liberty of an attainded Peer, that is, to have been heard at the Bar of the Houſe of Lords, and to have ſhew'd Cauſe why he ſhould not be executed according to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure of that Act by which he ſtood attainded. But you, I conceive, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to have his Blood, and therefore you would not complement him with that piece of Juſtice which is due to every man that is found guilty of any capital Offence: So that he being deny'd of this piece of Juſtice, I do affirm, that he by your Clemency and Tenderneſs was baſely betray'd and murder'd.</p>
               <p>Well, did the buſineſs of the <hi>Weſt</hi> end ſo? No, for remember how many of them by your Villanous <hi>Kirk</hi> were murder'd and hang'd up in cool Blood, without any manner of proceeding according to the form of Law and Juſtice; and this being taken notice of by your own Crew, that had heard of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Clemency and Tenderneſs, as a thing that would not ſound well in the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56278:72"/>
Nation; therefore the remainder were confined, and your Villain <hi>Jefferies</hi> and his murdering Brethren were ſent down to try theſe poor unfortunate wretches, from many of whom a Confeſſion was extorted upon the Promiſe of Pardon, and then they were condemn'd and murder'd, they being innocent of what they had confeſs'd againſt themſelves; others that had been in actual Arms hundreds of them were hang'd in the principal Towns, and their Quarters hang'd up in the Highways, as laſting Monuments of your Grace and Compaſſion.</p>
               <p>And you being glutted with Blood, you then thought of other Puniſhments for ſome other of thoſe Offenders; many Men and Women were order'd to be whip'd publickly in the Market-Towns, others had their Eſtates ſeiz'd, and a great number were ſold into <hi>America,</hi> to ſerve all days of their Lives; ſo that there was nothing but the Voice of lamentation and weeping to be heard. In a word, your Grace, Clemency and Tenderneſs was ſuch, that ſeveral of the Weſtern Counties were made ſo many Fields of Blood and Butchery: Nay, Sir, thoſe who eſcaped your Mercy by vertue of your Proclamation, were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to retire to the Woods and deſolate places, their neareſt and deareſt Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not daring ſo much as to harbour or relieve them, ſo that ſeveral ſtarved to death, or periſh'd with cold for want of things neceſſary for the preſervation of Human Nature: Some fled to the <hi>Dutch</hi> for ſhelter, and were not only kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiv'd, but as civily entertain'd, till you began to have ſome Shame in you, and pardon'd ſome, in hopes that they would be of uſe to you; and others came over with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who, by the Juſt Judgment of God upon you and your Adherents, baniſh'd you the Kingdom, and the Lords and Commons of <hi>England</hi> depoſed you as uſeleſs to God and Man.</p>
               <p>But, Sir, this is notorious, that you never entertain'd the leaſt Remorſe of Conſcience for the murther of theſe men in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> for thoſe you pardon'd paid a Price ſufficient for their Pardons; or if you gave them Pardon freely, it was to prevent their ſetting up their Trades in other Countries. And <hi>Jefferies</hi> your Tool, that you ought to have hang'd, you let him go off with no other Puniſhment than to be made Lord High Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> who alſo did enrich himſelf with the Sum of 15000 <hi>l.</hi> extorted from one perſon who wanted a Pardon, for nothing elſe but the not delivering his Country, which he might have done for half the Mony. I am more ſorry that <hi>Jefferies</hi> got the Mony, than for that Gentleman's loſing that Sum. Truly, Sir, I was in hopes that the Time of that Villain <hi>Jefferies</hi> had been come, in which he ſhould not only have paid his Debt to Nature, but to his Faults too; but he is gone to his Place, and thereby he hath ſav'd the Hangman a Labour; but had he liv'd, he would in my opinion have been made an Example for all his Villanies that he had committed, both as a corrupt Judge and a trayterous Chancellor.</p>
               <p>3. You were pleaſed in the years 1687 &amp; 1688, to publiſh a Declaration for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> and profeſſed in both the ſaid Declarations, <hi>That it was always your Judgment that no man's Conſcience ſhould be reſtrain'd in Matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> Now, Sir, if that were true, why then did you perſecute the <hi>Proteſtant Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi> for their <hi>Conſcience,</hi> from <hi>Feb.</hi> 6. 1684, till the latter end of the year 1686? And if it were not your Judgment, why then did you proclaim <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> as your Judgment? But, Sir, to deal truly in the point, you had a Popiſh Fabrick to erect, and you wanted <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> to be the Scaffold;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56278:73"/>
and when you had done your buſineſs of ſettling <hi>Popery,</hi> you would have laid <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> aſide, as your Brethren abroad of the <hi>Popiſh Religion</hi> have always done. And this was the Clemency your Brother was pleas'd to ſhew to <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and afterwards he and you could with great Tenderneſs ſuffer them to periſh in Priſon; and you your ſelf, when you were in the Chair, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted them, to the ruine of ſome Thouſands of Families; you ſurfeited your ſelf and Party with the murder and ruine of ſo many Men, and yet you pretend to Clemency and Tenderneſs. To conclude this particular, your Brother and you made two Declarations for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> for no other intent but to cheat the People of <hi>England</hi> into Slavery and Popery, to the end that you might damn the Body and Soul of the Nation at once. From ſuch Clemency and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs I truſt God hath deliver'd this Nation, and will preſerve her under the preſent Government, all your pretences to the contrary notwithſtanding.</p>
               <p>4. What ſhall I ſay of thoſe worthy perſons that you kept in Jayl for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Damages of 100000 <hi>l.</hi> and others of 10000 <hi>l.</hi> and others for one Fine or another? What ſhall I ſay of the Murther of the Lady <hi>Liſle,</hi> and Alderman <hi>Corniſh,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ayliff,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Nelthrope,</hi> and poor <hi>Diſney?</hi> Theſe were Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of your Clemency and Tenderneſs.</p>
               <p>3. You promis'd in your Speech to the Council, That you would maintain the Church of <hi>England</hi> as it was eſtabliſh'd by Law. Nay, I think, if you had not wrong done you, you ſwore it too at your Coronation. And, <hi>Sir,</hi> (if you pleaſe) call to mind how you kept your Promiſe and Oath in relation to the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt;</hi> nay, you gave a reaſon for your Promiſe, it being the only Reaſon that you ever gave in your Life, I will put you in mind of it, <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaid you, <hi>Her Members had ſhew'd themſelves Loyal Subjects,</hi> and <hi>that the Principles of the Church of</hi> England <hi>had been for Monarchy.</hi> Therefore,</p>
               <p n="1">1. How did you maintain the Church of <hi>England</hi> as by Law eſtabliſh'd? Were there not Laws in force for the preſervation of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that had been enacted in the Reigns of ſeveral Princes that were your Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, amongſt which Laws, as a ſecurity of the Church of <hi>England</hi> againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> 
                  <q>That all perſons whatſoever, that were advanced to any Eccleſiaſtical Dignity, or to bear Office in either Univerſity, as likewiſe all Civil and Military Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, ſhould declare they were not <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and that by taking the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, and the Teſt;</q> yet you and your Conſpirators annulled all thoſe Laws that were made to ſecure the Proteſtant Religion againſt Popery. Was this to defend the Church of <hi>England</hi> and to maintain Her Laws? I leave it to all men to judge. But you and your vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous Commiſſioners thought your ſelves ſo wiſe, as to reconcile Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and therefore you were reſolv'd to try your Skill upon the Church and the Nurſeries of Learning; which prov'd fatal to you and your Party by the Juſt Vengeance of Almighty God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Did you not, againſt expreſs Law, and againſt the Promiſe of your main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſet up an Eccleſiaſtical Commiſſion, and impower the Perſons named in that illegal Commiſſion to take cognizance, and to give ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary directions in matters Eccleſiaſtical, in which Commiſſion there was one who profeſs'd the Popiſh Religion, and others that were Abettors of Popery and Popiſh Superſtition; therefore to what deplorable condition was the Church of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56278:73"/>
                  <hi>England</hi> reduc'd, that a Commiſſioner for the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s Affairs ſhould publickly abjure the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> by which means he was not only very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, but alſo uncapable of holding any publick Employment! And did not the <hi>Banditti</hi> give you ſuch proof of their ſubmiſſion to your Popiſh Directions you gave them, that they had continued in their Places to this day, had not God of his Infinite Mercy deliver'd us from them and your ſelf? For they were men of an agreeable diſpoſition to have furthered your deſigns of <hi>Popery,</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all your Promiſes to maintain the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for they took care that none ſhould be prefer'd that had any zeal for the <hi>Proteſtant Religion;</hi> for, if you will be ſerious in conſidering who they were that you prefer'd to the Dignities in the Church, and upon what terms, you muſt own, that they were men of ſuch Morals and Principles, as render'd them a very ſcandal to that villanous Deſign that you and your Conſpirators were carrying on againſt the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I pray, Sir, was the ſuſpenſion of the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> another demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your Purpoſe and Reſolution to maintain the Church of <hi>England?</hi> Let any of your trayterous Crew ſtand forth and anſwer for you; Was not that Prelate ſuſpended for refuſing to obey an Arbitrary Order ſent to him by your <hi>Banditti</hi> Commiſſioners for the ſuſpending of Dr. <hi>Sharp,</hi> now Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> for preaching againſt <hi>Popery</hi> according to his Office and Calling, without ſo much as citing the ſaid Dr. <hi>Sharp</hi> before him to make his defence, or obſerving any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon forms of Proceſs commonly us'd in ſuch caſes: The Biſhop comply'd with your Suſpenſion, and what damage it was to him he can tell better than I; but it did <hi>work for our Good,</hi> and haſten'd our Deliverance, but it ſhew'd that you had but little regard to your Oath and Promiſe to maintain the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Another Specimen you gave us of your pious Reſolution of maintaining the Ch. of <hi>England</hi> as by Law eſtabliſh'd, was the dealing with <hi>Magdalen Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford.</hi> In the firſt place you turn'd out the Preſident, who was legally choſen by the Fellows of the Colledge, who, if I miſtake not, are ſworn to chuſe one from among themſelves to bear that Office; then you turn'd out all the Fellows for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to chuſe one of your recommendation, without ſo much as citing them to appear before any Court that could take legal cognizance in that affair, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining any Sentence againſt them by a competent Judge; and the only reaſon you gave for the turning them out, was, becauſe they had refus'd a perſon that was a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> who was not only uncapable by the Laws of the Land, but alſo by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of that Colledge, of bearing the Office of a Preſident or Fellow of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. And having expel'd both Preſident and Fellows, you put the ſaid Colledge into the hands of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that you might the better maintain the Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the Ch. of <hi>England</hi> as by Law eſtabliſh'd. But I hope it may be a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to that Community, and to all others of that Univerſity, how they advance the Prerogative of the Crown ſo high, and nouriſh thoſe two peſtilent Doctrins of <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> and <hi>Non-Reſiſtance,</hi> and the Divine Right of Succeſſion, leſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> thoſe Doctrins do expoſe them to a greater Danger than the laſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another demonſtration that was given by you of your ſtedfaſt Purpoſes of ſtanding by and maintaining of the Ch. of <hi>England,</hi> was your proceeding againſt the Vice Chancellor of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> 1687. You had a great Favour for one <hi>Francis</hi> a <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monk, a Rogue that was fit for any Villany that you could put him upon to act; him you ſent to <hi>Cambridge</hi> to corrupt the Youth there, and no doubt
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56278:74"/>
but for his time he did the buſineſs for which you ſent him. You planted him in <hi>Sidney</hi> Colledge, where you had placed one <hi>Baſſet</hi> a Papiſt in that Houſe as Maſter, but your Monk had an Apartment, wherein he perform'd the Office of a Prieſt according to the Ch. of <hi>Rome;</hi> but being a Fellow that had taken no Degrees in any Univerſity either at home or abroad, you were reſolv'd that he ſhould be a Maſter of Arts in the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge;</hi> and in order to this you ſent a Letter to the ſaid Vice-Chancellor, to admit the ſaid Father <hi>Francis</hi> to be a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Arts without taking the Oaths; which the Vice-Chancellor refus'd, as contrary to the Law of the Land and the Statutes of the Univerſity: Upon this you caus'd the Vice-Chancellor and the Delegates of the Univerſity to be ſummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before your Commiſſioners of Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, where that Villain <hi>Jeffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> contrary to all Law or Reaſon, pronounced Sentence, that the Vice-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor being guilty of great Diſobedience to the King's Commands, and other Crimes and Contempts, ſhould be depriv'd of the Office of Vice-Chancellor, and ſuſpended of his headſhip of <hi>Magdalen Colledge</hi> in the ſaid Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge.</hi> Thus, Sir, you were pleas'd to maintain the Ch. of <hi>England,</hi> by ſuffering the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Gravity of that Univerſity to be trampl'd upon, and by letting in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of ſilly, impudent, and illiterate Popiſh Prieſts and Fryers, who were to joyn with you in ſupporting the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> as it was then by Law eſtabliſh'd. Unleſs your Commiſſioners of Eccleſiaſtical Affairs judg'd that to deſtroy the two Univerſities as to Learning, and to break in upon their Laws made to preſerve their Communities, would be a means to preſerve the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I cannot but wonder at thoſe extravagant Proceedings in the laſt years of your Tyranny againſt them, ſince they had ſo highly eſpouſed your Cauſe when you were Duke of <hi>York,</hi> againſt the Sence of the whole Nation.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Another Reaſon you give us to believe that you did deſign to ſtand by and ſupport and maintain the Ch. of <hi>England,</hi> was your proceeding and cauſing to be ſummoned before your Eccleſiaſtical Commiſſioners all the Chancellors and Archdeacons of <hi>England,</hi> and requiring them to certifie the Names of thoſe Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen who had read the Declaration for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> as well as the Names of thoſe who had refuſed the ſame, without conſidering that the reading of it was not enjoyn'd the Clergy by the Biſhops, who are their Ordinaries: So that this was another way you intended (even by theſe extrajudicial Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in your Court of Commiſſioners Eccleſiaſtical) to maintain the Liberties of the Ch. of <hi>England.</hi> This was one great cauſe why ſeveral Perſons of Quality both in Church and State refuſed to be concern'd in this Commiſſion, for they at laſt clearly ſaw, that this damnable Commiſſion tended to nothing leſs than the total Subverſion of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> for you us'd it to no other end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe than to oppreſs ſuch perſons as were eminent for Learning and Virtue, that ſhould at any time or ſeaſon preach againſt <hi>Popery</hi> &amp; <hi>Superſtition.</hi> And it was God's great Mercy to the <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt</hi> that they did at laſt ſee, for ſure I am that in the latter part of your Brother's time, and in the beginning of your time, they were given up to ſuch a ſecure ſtate, and judicial blindneſs, that the <hi>Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> was in greater danger of being ſuppreſt than ever it was ſince the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, notwithſtanding your Promiſe of maintaining and preſerving it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Another Indication of your Care for the maintenance of the Ch. of <hi>England</hi> was the breaking thro' thoſe Laws which forbid the erecting Churches and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56278:74"/>
for the exerciſe of the <hi>Popiſh Religion,</hi> and alſo againſt Monaſteries and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, and more particularly againſt the Order of the Jeſuites; for you did, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to your Oath and Promiſe made to ſupport the Ch. of <hi>England,</hi> give out ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary and illegal Orders to erect Monaſteries; and in contempt of the Law you ſet up ſeveral Colledges of Jeſuites to corrupt the Youth of the Nation. Nay, Sir, that you might not leave your ſelf without Witneſs of your ſtedfaſt Reſolution of maintaining, ſupporting and defending the Ch. of <hi>England,</hi> you rais'd up a Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite that was in the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> in which the death of the King your kind and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Brother was plotted and contriv'd, and the ſubverſion of the Government both in Church and State, to be a Privy Councillor and a Miniſter of State: By all which you did evidently ſhew, that you were reſtrain'd by no Laws, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ch. of <hi>England</hi> muſt periſh, you being ſo well ſeconded in your Popiſh Progreſs by your moſt excellent Commiſſioners of Eccleſiaſtical Affairs. But to conclude this Paragraph, how thoſe Villains that acted in that Commiſſion of yours can look Mankind in the Face, after they have done ſo many things againſt all Law, Honour and Conſcience, I do not underſtand: The truth is, thoſe that are yet alive have with the Whore in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> wiped their Mouths, and ſay, <hi>They have done no wickedneſs;</hi> and, without all doubt, if they might be truſted, would with as great earneſtneſs appear againſt your Cauſe and Intereſt, as they did wickedly in your time eſpouſe it; but they would be ſuch a Reproach to an honeſt Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as would render the beſt and moſt honeſt Cauſe ſuſpicious, if engag'd in it.</p>
               <p>IV. I come now to conſider a 4th Paſſage in your Speech to the Council, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you were pleas'd to ſay, <hi>That you had been reported to have been a man for Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power, but you did aſſure them that you would preſerve the Government in Church and State, as by Law eſtabliſh'd;</hi> And <hi>That you knew that the Laws of</hi> England <hi>were ſufficient to make the King as great a Monarch as he could wiſh.</hi> How you preſerv'd the Government of the Church, is plain enough; nothing indeed is more plain than this, that you intended its Deſtruction and utter Subverſion, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs would ſerve your turn, notwithſtanding its Principles were for Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, and its Members had ſhew'd themſelves Loyal Subjects. How fared it then with the State? Surely the Civil Government was preſerv'd, ſince the Laws of <hi>England</hi> were ſufficient to make the King as great a Monarch as he could wiſh: In truth, Sir, there was but a lamentable account to be given to your more than Glorious Succeſſor of your management of Affairs in the Civil Government, all things were out of order at his acceſſion to the <hi>Crown,</hi> which you may have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; therefore, Sir, be pleas'd to remember, in the firſt place, your Villains of your Council, and of your Eccleſiaſtical Commiſſion: As they were in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy againſt the Ch. of <hi>England,</hi> to turn our Religion into downright <hi>Popery,</hi> ſo they were in a Conſpiracy againſt the State, to turn the well eſtabliſh'd Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Land into downright <hi>Slavery,</hi> and this not ſecretly, as if thoſe <hi>Raſcals</hi> were not aſham'd of what they did, for they had that matchleſs Impudence to act in an open and undiſguis'd manner; and to carry on your villanous purpoſes, you and your Accomplices ſet up the <hi>Diſpenſing Power,</hi> by vertue of which you might ſuſpend and diſpenſe with the execution of the Laws at your pleaſure: and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to give this deviliſh Maxim of yours and your Conſpirators countenance and credit, you ſo manag'd that matter, that you obtain'd an Opinion from the <hi>Judges,</hi> moſt of which were mercenary Rogues, who declar'd their opinion, <hi>That this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſing</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:56278:75"/>
                  <hi>Power</hi> was in the Kings of <hi>England;</hi> as if it were in the power of theſe Villains to offer up the Laws and Liberties of the whole Nation to your ſelf, to be diſpos'd of by you arbitrarily at your pleaſure, and expreſly contrary to thoſe Laws that were enacted for the liberty of the Subject.</p>
               <p>In order to obtain this Judgment, your Conſpirators did before hand examine ſecretly the Sentiments of the Judges, and procur'd ſuch of them as could not in Conſcience concur in ſo villanous an opinion or ſentence to be turn'd out, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that had neither Law nor Conſcience were ſubſtituted in their rooms, ſo that by changing of hands they found out 12 matchleſs Rogues, from whom you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd that wicked Judgment which, if my Memory fail me not, was laid down in theſe 5 particulars. 1. <hi>That the Kings of</hi> England <hi>are Soveraign Princes.</hi> 2. <hi>That the Laws of</hi> England <hi>are the King's Laws.</hi> 3. <hi>That it is an inſeparable Prerogative of the K. of</hi> Engl. <hi>to diſpenſe with Penal Laws upon neceſſity and urgent occaſions.</hi> 4. <hi>That the K. is the ſole Judge of that neceſſity.</hi> 5. <hi>That this is not in Truſt given to the K. but 'tis the ancient Remains of the Crown, which ne'r was nor can be taken from him.</hi> Give me leave, Sir, to examin theſe Particulars, and let the world ſee how you were abus'd, and how you abus'd the Government by the <hi>Opinions</hi> of theſe 12 <hi>mercenary Rogues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Kings of</hi> England <hi>were Soveraign Princes.</hi> What then? Muſt you by a <hi>Diſpenſing Power</hi> do what you liſt? were you not ſubject to thoſe Laws which you were ſworn to keep? And if you had not fled, might you not have been call'd to an account? Might not the People, from whom you deriv'd your <hi>Authority,</hi> have had any Power over you? And was it not dangerous both to Church and State to have a Popiſh Prince ſo mighty, that no <hi>Proteſtant Houſe of Peers</hi> or <hi>Commons</hi> dare controul him? Truly, Sir, I own that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> are ſoveraign Princes, yet the Nation by their Repreſentatives did ne'r allow the Kings of <hi>England</hi> to do what 12 <hi>mercenary Judges</hi> ſhould deliver as their Opinions; for, Sir, it was ne'r in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended when you aſſumed the <hi>Government,</hi> that your <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure</hi> ſhould ſtand for a <hi>Law,</hi> for the <hi>Laws</hi> that ſupport the Grandeur of the Crown limited your <hi>Will</hi> to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and ty'd your <hi>Commands</hi> to the <hi>Word of God,</hi> the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Realm,</hi> and the <hi>Weal</hi> of the <hi>People.</hi> And ſince, Sir, you regarded not theſe things, but follow'd the <hi>Sentiments</hi> of your <hi>corrupt Judges,</hi> your <hi>Will</hi> was unlawful, and <hi>Commands</hi> unjuſt.</p>
               <p>The Kings of <hi>England</hi> always have been, and ſtill are <hi>Soveraign Princes,</hi> but what makes them ſo? Is it not the Law of the Land? And doth not the Law ſet a boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary to their <hi>Government</hi> as well as to the Peoples <hi>Obedience?</hi> Is there not a mutual Contract between King and People? Now, when any K. ſhall by a <hi>Suſpending</hi> or <hi>Diſpenſing Power</hi> diſſolve this Contract, and break in upon our Laws, and overturn the Government, the People ceaſe to be his Subjects, and he to be their King. It is your own caſe, Sir, by your <hi>Diſpenſing Power</hi> you did not only pretend to be above Law, but alſo that you were not bound by Law; tho' by your Oath you were as much bound to obſerve the Law as a King, as your People were bound to obſerve the Laws as your Subjects. But the People of <hi>England</hi> ſeeing that it was in vain to expect any <hi>Juſtice</hi> or <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> from you, (for means of reformation was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, but was denied to be comply'd withal) ſeveral noble Lords ſaw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſlighted, their Counſels rejected, and the Proteſtant Religion upon its laſt Legs, they therefore did implore the help of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> now our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious King; he comes over, ſeizeth your Treaſure, your fortified places, Navy, and Naval Stores, and with one Conſent of the People of <hi>England</hi> was made our Sove<hi>-L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:56278:75"/>
2. The Laws of <hi>England</hi> are the Kings Laws; if your <hi>Diſpenſing Vermin</hi> did mean by the Laws being your Laws, that is, that you were intruſted with the Conſervation and the Execution of them, then we agree with the Rogues; but how doth this Truſt repoſed in the King, for the time being, intitle him to Suſpend and Diſpenſe with theſe Laws: but if by the Laws being yours they underſtood that they were your Property, either to Execute or not Execute, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to keep or break at your pleaſure: I pray Sir, to what end were they made, and to what end were you Sworn, to keep and maintain theſe Laws, why was there the trouble of an Oath to keep the Law? But Sir, here they laid down a notorious falſhood, for the Laws of <hi>England</hi> are the Laws made by King and People as the Rule of the Government of the King on the one hand, and of the Obedience of the People on the other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it is an inſeparable Prerogative of the King of <hi>England</hi> to Diſpenſe with Penal Laws upon neceſſity and urgent Occaſions, this was laid down as good Law. But Sir, I pray conſider, were not all the Laws of <hi>England</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by the King and the People of <hi>England,</hi> met in Parliament, for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Government and of the Subject; how then could theſe Villains give you a Power of annulling theſe Laws at your Will and Pleaſure, ſince you could not ſuſpend or diſpenſe with them, but by the ſame Authority by which they were made? It is true, the King of <hi>England,</hi> for the time being, may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don a Puniſhment that a Tranſgreſſor hath incurred, and to which he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, as in caſes of Fellony and Treaſon, yet it cannot be inferred from hence, with any colour of reaſon, that you or any other King could intirely ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the Execution of thoſe Laws relating to Fellony or Treaſon, unleſs, Sir, your villainous Judges could have proved by any other Authority, than barely their Opinions that you were cloathed with a Diſpotick and Arbitrary Power, and that the Lives and Liberties, Honours and Eſtates of the People of <hi>England,</hi> did depend wholly upon your good Will and Pleaſure, and were intirely ſubject to you, which muſt infallibly follow on your having a Power to ſuſpend the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Laws, and to diſpence with them.</p>
               <p>It may be Sir, ſome of your Diſpenſers may ſay, That you were not well infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med when you took the Coronation-Oath to maintain the Laws of the Land, and that you had prejudiced your ſelf greatly by yielding to the Oath, and that you had weakened your Authority too much in ſubmitting your ſelf to the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Laws.</p>
               <p>Theſe things were much talked of by ſome of your Bully Conſpirators, when they little dreamed of your taking the Air at St. <hi>Germains:</hi> Nay, ſome of the Devils Brokers roared this out of their Pulpits by the direction of <hi>Old Hodge</hi> their guide. But, Sir, I pray, inform me how it could be that you ſhould not be well informed, when you yielded to take the Oath at your Coronation to obſerve, and keep the Laws of the Land? It is impoſſible that you ſhould be ignorant of that which all the World knew, and all your Predeceſſors before you; as it was almoſt impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that you ſhould not be acquainted with the Oath that you were to take, and the Laws you were to preſerve by that Oath. So this, know that you were bound to thoſe Laws immediately upon taking the Oath; and I wonder much that you ſhould be a ſtranger to the Coronation Oath, and to the Laws by which you were
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56278:76"/>
to defend your Government that had been twenty four Years a looker on in the Reign of your Brother. Therefore this Plea is as frivilous, as the Opinion of your never to be forgiven Judges was Impudent and againſt Law. But this is one of the madeſt Thoughts that ever you, or your villainous Judges could be guilty of, that it was a blemiſh to the Sovereign Power of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> to ſubmit to the Laws. I pray, Sir, What blemiſh would it have been to your So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Power to have ſubmitted to the Laws of your Countrey, which your Predeceſſors were contented to acknowledge and obſerve? You derived your Authority to your ſelf by virtue of the Laws? Why then was the Obſervation of the Laws ſuch a prejudice to you and your Sovereign Power? But we ſaw the Laws broken, and you forſworn, and your Subjects depoſed you. In this, I am ſure, you have found a greater blemiſh and prejudice, than the obſervation of the Laws would have been.</p>
               <p>But to be ſhort, you may plead for your ſelf and your Judges, That were under a neceſſity and an urgent occaſion. Well, What was that neceſſity? What were thoſe urgent occaſions that could put you upon forſwearing your ſelf, and bringing your ſelf under the guilt of Perjury. In truth, Sir, your neceſſity you lay under, was the ſubverſion of the Proteſtant Religion, and bringing in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and the ſubverſion of the Civil Government, and bringing in Tyranny and Slavery. Is not Perjury a moſt grievous Offence, but much more grievous when it is voluntarily committed? And then a King committeh Perjury willingly when he doth any thing willingly againſt the Oath he hath taken, not by force but by freewil, not unadviſedly but with great conſideration, not to his hurt but to his advantage, not to perform a thing that was impoſſible or diſhoneſt, but to bind himſelf to a condition that is honeſt and poſſible too. Now when a King breaketh ſuch an Oath, there can be no colour or pretence of neceſſity, or urgent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to excuſe his Perjury.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the King of <hi>England</hi> is ſole Judge of that neceſſity. I never took you ſo much behind hand in Senſe and Reaſon, but that you might plainly ſee that this is but a bantre of theſe Rogues, for they neither ſtated the neceſſity and the urgent occaſions you had to forſwear your ſelf, and never inquired whether any neceſſity, or any urgent occaſions could excuſe you from lying under the guilt of Perjury. Then they came off with an impudent lye, and ſay the King is ſole Judge of that neceſſity. He is ſole Judge of nothing but what he is intitled to by the Law; where the Law makes him a ſole Judge there I do, and own my ſelf bound to obey him as ſuch. But once more, Sir, Where was this neceſſity of which you were to be ſole Judge? When did it ſpring? Out of what part of the World? I believe, if you could have convinced the Nation of this neceſſity, and theſe urgent occaſions, they would not ſo readily concurred to your going to St. <hi>Germains,</hi> were your Popiſh Friends oppreſſed. And did the neceſſity ariſe from thence? If it did, Why did you not tell the Parliament of this Oppreſſion? Were they in want of Places at Court, and Imployments under you, which they could not hold? Truly a great many Proteſtants went without them, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their being qualified. Oh! but the Prieſts of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were in danger of the Law. I never could yet ſee that day. If they would be quiet, and the Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was your Religion: Well, if it was,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56278:76"/>
Had you not better to have refuſed the Crown rather than to have taken it with ſuch Incumbrances and Clogs, as ſhould expoſe you to ſuch neceſſities and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent occaſions of Perjuring your ſelf, and Damning your Soul, and Ruining of three Kingdoms? It was well you were the ſole Judge of the neceſſity; for if an honeſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament had ſat in the time of your neceſſity and urgent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, they would have made theſe Rogues have ſwung for their villainous Advice.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That this is not in Truſt given to the King, but the Antient Remains of the Crown, which never was, nor can be taken from him; you, nor no King in <hi>England,</hi> ever had any thing but what you received in Truſt from the People of <hi>England</hi> in Parliament aſſembled, therefore this was the greateſt of Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that theſe Twelve ignorant Devils could be guilty of, for what Authority, Power, or Riches, have the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> but what they received from the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and it is plain the Power and Authority that you received was for the benefit of the People, and not for the ruin and deſtruction of the Laws you conſented to; you were intruſted with the Conſervation of them, not to Suſpend, or Diſpenſe with them at your will and pleaſure.</p>
               <p>But what King of <hi>England</hi> was there, ſince the pretended Conqeſt, that was not Sworn to keep the Laws, and defend the Rights and Liberties of the Church and People of <hi>England?</hi> and who Adminiſtred this Oath to them? but one or more, in the behalf of themſelves and all the People of <hi>England.</hi> Your Brother, though bad enough, took the Government as a truſt repoſed in him by his good People of <hi>England,</hi> what part was it then that was not a Truſt? they truſted him with vaſt ſums of money, they truſted you but with a very little. I pray Sir, would your Scoundril Conſpirators but tell me what parts were the Remains of the Crown, and how they came ſo to be; if they cannot it is all Cheat and Nonſence. By your management (notwithſtanding all that might have been ſaid to the contrary, even in your Reign, without the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being hanged,) you obtained from your Judges this wicked Opinion. I ſuppoſe you were not Idle, but was reſolved to proceed according to this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theirs; for you preſently invaded the Liberties both of Church and State. I have given you ſome inſtances of your Invaſion upon the Rights of the People of <hi>England,</hi> in relation to Matters of the Church. Now let us proceed to ſee how you carried your ſelf in reference to the Civil Rights and Liberties of the People of <hi>England,</hi> which brings me to a ſecond Inſtance of your invading our Civil Rights.</p>
               <p>2. As your Brother did begin, and made a very great Progreſs in, ſo you went on to invade Priviledges, and to ſeize the Charters of the Towns that had a right to be repreſented in Parliament; and by your Tools procured Surrenders of them to be made to you, eſpecially where they were poor, and not able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them. And a Gentleman that valued himſelf upon his Oath that he had made to a Corporation, whereof he was a Magiſtrate, and therefore refuſed to deliver the ſame; you rewarded him with a two or three years impriſonment, and had not God interpoſed, it had been to the ruin of himſelf, his Wife and Children. By theſe Surrenders, Sir, you cauſed all the Magiſtrates to give up
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56278:77"/>
their Rights and Priviledges, to be diſpoſed of at your pleaſure, and the pleaſure of your Villains the Conſpirators; and by this means you placed in ſeveral of theſe Towns Popiſh Magiſtrates, notwithſtanding their incapacity, or ſuch as were Popiſhly affected, and willing to concur with you in all your evil Deſigns and Purpoſes, aſſuring your ſelf, that when neceſſity, or your urgent Occaſions ſhould force you to call a Parliament, you might have ſuch a Parliament re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned as ſhould at once ſet up Popery and Arbitrary Power. Nay, Sir, our danger in your time, and in the time of your loving and kind Brother, did moſt (and doth ſtill) ariſe from thoſe Beggarly and Paltry Borroughs that either are by Charter or Preſcription enabled to ſend Members to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
               <p>3. That you might not fail in the Counties of obtaining your wicked ends, you gave Orders to Examin all Lords Lieutenants, Deputy Lieutenants, Sheriffs, Juſtices of the Peace, and all other that were in any Publick Employments, if they would Concur with you in the Repealing the Teſt and Penal Laws; and thoſe whoſe Conſciences would not permit them to comply with your wicked Deſigns and Purpoſes were turned out, and others who you found would be more compliant to you in your intentions, in defeating the End and Execution of thoſe Laws which had been made with ſo much Care and Caution, to preſerve not only the Proteſtant Religion, but alſo our Civil Rights and Liberties; and into many of thoſe places you put in Papiſts, and other perſons of Arbitrary Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; notwithſtanding the Law had incapacitated the former, and the other for want of Reputation and Intereſt could do their Country but little Service; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, like Devils, they could do miſchief by ſerving your Deſigns, and the Purpoſes of your Conſpirators: ſo that this Nation was in a deplorable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and muſt have periſhed had not God raiſed up the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> now our King, to come over and deliver us out of your Hands.</p>
               <p>4. As your Brother in his time hated the Peoples Petitioning him for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of their Grievances, and had a Set of Men ready to Abhor and Deteſt ſuch Popular Petitions, though it was the Subjects Right to Petition the King for the redreſs of Grievances, under which they groaned in his Reign. So you was pleaſed to ſhew your averſneſs to Petitioning; witneſs your proceeding againſt the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the other Biſhops, who offered a moſt humble Petition to you in terms full of Reſpect, and exceeded not the number limited by Law, in which they ſet forth their Reaſons for which they could not obey a certain Order; which you, by the Advice of your Popiſh Villains, ſent them to appoint their Clergy to Read in their Chruches, the Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience, they were ſent to Priſon; and afterwards brought to a Tryal, as if they had been guilty of ſome enormous Crime, they were not only obliged to defend themſelves under this Perſecution; but alſo to appear before four Villains, one Profeſſed Papiſt, and the other three had not taken the Teſt, and by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence were Men whoſe Intereſt and Inclination too led them to Condemn them. And the Judges that gave their Opinion in favour of thoſe Prelates were turned out; thus you may ſee a fourth Inſtance you have given us of your invading our Civil Rights.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:56278:77"/>
But, Sir, while I ſpeak to you of theſe things, give me leave to plead with you, What King was there that ever reigned that was too great to be petitioned by the meaneſt of his Subjects? It cannot be pretended that any Kings how great ſoever their Power hath been, and how Arbitrary and Diſpotick they have been in the exerciſe of this Power, have ever reckoned it a Crime for their Subjects to come with all ſubmiſſion and reſpect, in a due number, not exceeding the limits of the Law, to repreſent Reaſons why they could not execute ſuch, or ſuch an Order. Deal freely with the World, ſend to your Diſpenſing Rogues, and ask them whether it were one of the remains of the Crown that impowered you to wreſt out of the Hands of the Subject this undoubted Right of Petitioning the Prince for theredreſs of Grieveances?</p>
               <p>5. How did you treat a Peer of this Realm? Was he not uſed by you, and your villanious Conſpirators as a Criminal, only becauſe he ſaid, That the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were not bound to obey the Orders of a Popiſh Juſtice of the Peace? Tho it was evident that ſuch being by Law rendred uncapable of all ſuch Truſts: No regard was due to any of their Orders. This being the ſecurity which the People of <hi>England</hi> had, and ſtill have by the Law, for their Lives, Liberties, Honours and Eſtates, that they are not ſubjected to the Arbitrary Proceedings of Papiſts, that were contrary to Law put into any Imployment Civil or Military. This was another inſtance of the invaſion you made upon us, in reſpect of our Civil Rights and Liberties, and manifeſted your ſelf to be a Man for Arbitrary Government in ſubjecting our Perſons and Eſtates to the Arbitrary Proceedings of Popiſh Magiſtrates and Officers under you.</p>
               <p>6. You apprehending that the great Remedy of your Grievances, and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our Religion was a Free Parliament; and leaſt you might lie under a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of calling one, you and your Accomplices did endeavour to make it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, or at leaſt very difficult to be obtained; for you could not but appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that a Lawful Parliament being once Aſſembled, would call you and your Villains to an account for all your open Violations of the Law, and for your Plots and Conſpiracies againſt the Proteſtant Religion, and the Lives and Liberties of the People of <hi>England,</hi> you endeavoured, under the ſpecious pretence of <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> firſt to ſow Diviſions between the Proteſtants of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and Proteſtant Diſſenters; the Deſign being laid to engage all Proteſtants that are equally concerned to preſerve themſelves from Popiſh Oppreſſion into mutual Quarrellings. So that by theſe ſome Advantages might be taken by you to bring about your Villainous Deſigns and Purpoſes, and that both in the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Members of Parliament, and afterwards in the Parliament it ſelf; for you could not but ſee, that if all Proteſtants did enter into a mutual good underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one with another, and concur together in the preſerving our Civil Rights and Liberties, that it would have been poſſible for you and your <hi>Banditti</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh your wicked Ends. What could we expect from you, when you ſtruck at the Foundation of all our Civil Rights and Liberties, in the hindring the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Choice of a Free and Lawful Parliament? For did you not require all Perſons, in the ſeveral Counties of <hi>England,</hi> that either were in any Imployment, or were in any conſiderable Eſteem, to declare before hand that they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56278:78"/>
in the repeal of the <hi>Teſt</hi> and the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> and that they would give their Voices in the Elections to Parliament, only for ſuch as would concur in it? ſuch as would not thus pre-engage themſelves were turned out of all Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and others who entred into theſe Engagements were put into their Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; many of which are Papiſts, and contrary to the Charters and Priviledges of thoſe Burroughs, that have a right to ſend Burgeſſes to Parliament. You or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſuch Regulations to be made as you thought fit and neceſſary for the aſſuring your ſelf, and your villainous Conſpirators, of all the Members that were to be choſen by thoſe Corporations; and by this means you gave your ſelf, and Tribe, hope to avoid the being called to an account for your Villanies: though it was then, and is ſtill apparent that all Acts made by Popiſh Magiſtrates are Null and Void of themſelves; ſo that no Parliament could have been law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, for which Elections and Returns had been made by your Popiſh Sheriffs, and Mayors of Towns; and therefore, as long as the Authority and Magiſtracy was in ſuch Hands, it was impoſſible for us to have had a Lawful and a Free Parliament.</p>
               <p>You might have known that the Conſtitution of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government and Cuſtom, time out of mind. All Elections of Parliament Men ought to be made with an intire Liberty, without any ſort of force, or the requiring the Electors to chooſe ſuch perſons as ſhould be named to them; and the perſons thus freely Elected ought to give their Opinions freely upon all Matters that are brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, they having the good of the Nation before their Eyes, and following in all things the dictates of their Conſciences. Therefore you having uſurped an illegal Authority, and reſolving upon the utmoſt Violations of our Laws, you would not give us the leaſt hopes of having our Grievances redreſſed by a Free Parliament legally called and choſen.</p>
               <p>It is true, you would have called one in which all Elections ſhould have been carried by Fraud and Force, and might have been compoſed of ſuch perſons of whom you and your Trayterous Crew would have been well aſſured, in which all things would have been carried on by their Direction and Intereſt, without any regard to the Good and Welfare of this Nation, which I prove to you and your Villainous Crew, both at home and abroad. For did you not try the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the pack'd Parliament, that ſat down in the Year 1685, to gain them to conſent to the repeal of the <hi>Teſt</hi> and <hi>Penal Laws?</hi> And did you not diſſolve that Parliament when you found that you could neither by Promiſes, nor by Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings prevail with theſe very Members to comply with your wicked Deſigns; and thoſe who would not comply were branded, as if they were Diſturbers of the publick Peace? For you may remember, that though the Prince and Princeſs of <hi>Orange</hi> did endeavour to ſignifie in terms full of Reſpects and Duty to your ſelf, the juſt and deep regret all your wicked and ungodly Proceedings had given them; and in compliance to your deſires they had ſignified their Thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your Repealing the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> and <hi>Teſt,</hi> which though they did it in ſuch a manner that they had juſt Ground of hope, that they had propoſed an Expedient by which the Peace of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and a happy Agreement among the Subjects of all Perſwaſions might have been certainly
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56278:78"/>
ſettled. You and your Hellborn Crew put ſuch Villainous Conſtructions upon their honeſt and ſincere Intentions, as that you were not aſhamed to condemn them both as perſons that deſigned to diſturb the Quiet and Happineſs of the Kingdom. But, Sir, the people of <hi>England</hi> always Teſtified a moſt ſingular Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Eſteem for the Prince and Princeſs of <hi>Orange,</hi> as perſons zealouſly Affected with, and concerned for the Advancement of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> and <hi>Intereſt;</hi> and therefore many of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and many Gentlemen, and other perſons of Note, laid our miſerable Caſe before them, and beged their Aid and Aſſiſtance. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> upon due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our deplorable State, to which we were brought by you and your wicked Accomplices, found that in point of that Duty he owed to God, and in return of the great Value the people of <hi>England</hi> had for him, that he could no way excuſe himſelf from eſpouſing our Cauſe or Quarrel in a Matter of ſuch high Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and from Contributing to the utmoſt of his Power, for the maintaining both of our Religion, and our Laws, and our Liberties, and to ſecure us in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Enjoyment of all our Rights. Therefore he came over with a Force ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, which through the Bleſſing of the Great God, was ſufficient to ſuppreſs you and your villainous Conſpirators.</p>
               <p>You know, Sir, that as you and your Conſpirators were not only full of Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Guilty of the greateſt Inhumanities and Barbarities. So you and they were full of lies and deceit; for upon the coming over of this Great Prince, you were ſenſible of the Greatneſs of your Guilt, and had no great Confidence in your own Forces, which induced you to offer to the City of <hi>London</hi> ſome ſeeming Relief from their great Oppreſſion, you hoping thereby to beguile us of a firm Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and full Security of our Laws, Liberties, and Religion; and finding that the Kingdoms Eyes were fully opened, then you and your Hellborn Crew gave out, with as much Mallice as Falſeneſs, that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> intended to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer and Enſlave the Nation. No, Sir, the Deſign of that mighty <hi>Deliverer</hi> was the ſecurity of our enjoying our Religion, Laws and Liberties, and that there might be no danger of the Kingdoms relapſing into the like Miſeries for the time to come.</p>
               <p>Well, Sir, you remember that the Prince arrives and you fled before him. He no ſooner comes but he was bid welcome by all <hi>True Proteſtants.</hi> You run away. A <hi>Convention</hi> was called, and he, to our great Joy, was choſen our <hi>King.</hi> A <hi>Parliament</hi> ſits down, and his Majeſty joyned with them in making ſuch Laws, as have ſecured us and our All; he Fights our Battles; he Loves our Nation; and we Love our King, and we ſhall not refuſe any thing that may be for his Honour, Greatneſs, and Content. You are depoſed as uſeleſs in the ſight of God, and driven from amongſt Proteſtants to graze at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> where you may take your eaſe till the <hi>French</hi> King ſhall be as weary of your Company, as we were of your Wicked and Tyrannical Government. You have made many attempts to be reſtored; ſometimes you Threaten us, at other times you would Flatter us to a ſecond Entertainment; but that is but a fooliſh thought of your Counſellers at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> which brings me to the laſt point of my Memorial, which is to ſhew you,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:56278:79"/>
3. The Unreaſonableneſs of your attempting of your Return hither, on which particulars I hope you have leiſure enough to reflect, and to adviſe about with your worthy Miniſtry you have attending your Perſon there; but leaſt they ſhould not have Honour and Honeſty enough to deal plainly with you, I will lay down Six undeniable Arguments, why it is morally impoſſible that you ſhould be ever readmitted to reign over us. 1. Becauſe we cannot bind you by the moſt So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Oaths. 2. Becauſe we are Proteſtants. 3. Becauſe we are Engliſh-men. And, 4. Becauſe we are Free-men. 5. Becauſe we have a King of our own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Judgment, to whom we have ſworn Allegiance, who goeth out and in before us, and fights our Battles for us. 6. Becauſe of your Attempt upon the Perſon of our King, in employing your Traiterous Aſſaſſins to murder him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe we cannot bind you by the moſt Solemn Oaths; we ſaw our Laws over-turned, our Liberties ſeized, our Religion corrupted and ſubverted, and you Forſworn: The Laws of Nature taught us to provide for the defence of our All which was at Stake. And can any Man think it hard that the Kingdom laid you aſide? And we laying you aſide for the Breach of your Contract and Oath, made to the People of <hi>England;</hi> Can you expect that we ſhould in the leaſt be guilty of ſo baſe a Compliance, as to ſubmit our ſelves to the Government of a Man, that by his Abominable Perjury diſſolved his own Government? You have time now to conſider that Perjury in a King is a moſt Grievous Offence againſt God and his Own Crown and Dignity, but much more Grievous when it is vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantarily committed: And when a Prince committeth Perjury willingly, when he doth any thing willingly againſt his Coronation-Oath, taken not by Force, but by Free-will, not unadviſedly, but with great Conſideration, not to his Hurt, but to his Advantage, not to perform a Thing Diſhoneſt or Impoſſible, but that which is both Poſſible and Honeſt: For when a Prince (not being forced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by juſt Fear or irriſiſtible Neceſſity) breaketh ſuch an Oath as there can be no colour to excuſe his Perjury, it arguing him and convincing him of Fraud and Deceit, and gave occaſion to all thinking Men that you had no manner of regard to your Coronation-Oath; ſo it puts you under an abſolute Incapacity of being Reſtored, ſince the both Houſes of Parliament, upon the breach you made of your Contract, have thought fit to lay you aſide, as a Perſon uſeleſs and dangerous to the publick Weal of the Three Kingdoms. Your Pretences therefore to the Imperial Crown of this Realm are very fooliſh and frivolous, for by the Laws of all Nations, you having been guilty of the moſt notorious Perjury, you are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Infamous; and the Laws of your own Synagogue ſay that no Infamous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is fit for the Execution of an Office of Honour and Dignity; a perjured Man is always repelled from bearing witneſs in any Cauſe whatſoever, becauſe that being Convicted to have Forſworn himſelf in one Cauſe, it is not only a Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but a ſufficient Proof that he will Depoſe falſly in another: And this is ſo true, that altho he hath amended his Life yet he cannot be admitted for a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be it either in a Civil or a Criminal Cauſe. So, Sir, you having once For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworn your Self in ſubverting our Religion, Laws and Liberties, by the advice of a parcel of Men that feared not God, nor reverenced Men: How do you think that we can ever truſt you again? For if the Nation ſhould be brought under
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56278:79"/>
ſuch diſmal and deplorable Circumſtances, (which God avert) as once more to ſubmit to your Adminiſtration of the Government; it would not only be a ſtrong preſumptive Concluſion, but Proof that admits of no Objection that you would run again into the ſame Enormities, if not worſe; for I fear, and ſo do all <hi>True Proteſtants,</hi> that by your Crew that you have with you, you are poſſeſſed with ſtrange and very vile Opinions: And theſe are ſuch as have not only in times paſt, but are ſtill entertained by you, and your villainous Conſpirators both at home and abroad, about the Coronation Oath which you took when you entered upon the Adminiſtration of the Government of this Realm. And they are theſe Four, 1. That Subjects cannot receive an Oath of their Prince without the Authority of ſome Judge; and that a Promiſe made before no competent Judge can bind any Man, much leſs a Prince; and they have affirmed that this was your Caſe. I would have you remember, Sir, that he that adminiſtred you the Oath was a lawful and competent Judge, becauſe that Law and the Cuſtom of the Realm had made him ſo; and therefore to him you Swore, and in Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him you Swore to the whole Nation that you would defend their Laws and Liberties. In a word, this Coronation Oath you took was a lawful Oath, and not only ſo but it was lawfully taken, as well becauſe general Cuſtom hath the force and ſtrength of a Law; for the perſons preſent do ſtand, and are taken by general Cuſtom to have Power to give and receive that Oath. But a bold Aſſertor of your Cauſe was pleaſed once to tell me that there was no Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in being when you took this Oath; What then? When you took the Coronation Oath there were perſons (who upon your taking the Oath) that did take the Oath of Fealty and Homage to you in the behalf of themſelves, and all the Nobility, and Commons of <hi>England;</hi> and this Oath muſt avail them though abſent, as though they were preſent; and if they were to be bound by the one though abſent, then certainly you were bound by yours though they were not preſent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe wicked Conſpirators of yours have Aſſerted, That Princes being above the Law are not bound to obſerve Oaths and Contracts, which have their full force and ſtrength from the Law; and that Princes may alter and change their own Laws at their Pleaſure. This Doctrine was carefully propogated by your truſty <hi>Roger</hi> and his inferiour Clergy by your Direction, in order to bring about that wicked Deſign of yours of Subverting of the well eſtabliſhed Government of this Realm, and introducing <hi>French Slavery.</hi> But, Sir, this you muſt now know that the Princes of <hi>England</hi> are not above the Law, and therefore cannot alter them at their Pleaſure without the manifeſt breach of their Coronation Oath. I confeſs, they may by their Judges interpret the Law in an <hi>Interval</hi> of Parliament, and in time of Parliaments: The Parliament are the beſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of the Law, and not only ſo but the Kings of <hi>England</hi> by and with the advice and conſent of Parliament, and by the Authority of the ſame, may Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal and Abrogate Laws as they ſhall think fit. But what you did was againſt Laws in force, to the manifeſt breach of your Oath, and you rendered your ſelf odious to God, and diſpenced with thoſe Laws that were for the preſervation of Perſons, Honours, Eſtates, and Religion of the People of <hi>England;</hi> and by
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56278:80"/>
this means you diſſolved the Government, and for which Cauſe you were hated of the People; and at laſt the Kingdom departed from you; you provoked that God that made you a Man, and that People that made you a King.</p>
               <p>But, Sir, your truſty Guide <hi>Hodge,</hi> with his inferiour Clergy, deceived you much, and thoſe who believed this Doctrine, when they taught that your Oaths made to, and contract made with the People of <hi>England,</hi> had their full force and ſtrength from the Law of the Land; for they had their ſtrength and force from the Law of Nature which binds Kings, Princes, Lords, Prieſts, and all Men whatever. Therefore, Sir, did you not againſt the very Laws of Nature break your Contract with the People of <hi>England,</hi> and the Oath you made to them? Doth not the Law of Nature oblige all Princes to keep their Contracts even with their Enemies? How much more ought you to have kept your Contract with your Friends and People? How could you expect to wear the Name of an honeſt Man, ſince that the Laws of Honeſty charge Princes to keep their Oaths and Contracts? There is nothing becomes them better, nothing commendeth them more, and nothing that Men require ſo much at their hands.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place, Princes Oaths to, and Contracts with their Subjects and Allies, are as good as Laws, they have the ſame force as Laws, they have the ſame ſtrength and vertue againſt their Succeſſours which they have againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; nay, let me tell you, that they are of greater ſtrength than Princes Laws; for Laws may be Repealed, but Contracts can never be Revoked; and why ſo? The Reaſon is plain, That Laws may alter according to the neceſſity of Affairs, but Contracts and Oaths can never be Revoked, they admit of no Change, no Alteration; if once perfected they can neither receive Addition, Subſtraction, Diminution, or Enlargement, they muſt not be wreſted but taken according to the true meaning of King and People. But, Sir, you may ſay, Why may not Princes break their Oaths, and diſſolve their Contracts made with their Subjects at their Coronation? To this I give you this Anſwer.</p>
               <p>Before you had Sworn to maintain our Laws, Liberties and Religion, you were free; and before you made a Covenant with us, you were at your liberty: But when you had Sworn, and when you had perfected your Contract, then of neceſſity you were bound to keep and perform them; and you could not have added to, or detracted from any thing in ſuch a manner perfected, without the conſent of the people with whom you made this Contract; for we were to have been benefited by this Oath and Contract of yours, and not deceived again. If Princes may break their Oaths and Contracts made to, and with their Subjects, How can we deal with ſuch a King? How can we tell when we obey? We muſt be then at great uncertainties, and ſo by conſequenue we cannot be ſafe. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, Did it not lye at your door to have preſerved your ſelf from Scandal and Fraud? Of which you took no care; therefore you made no Conſcience of of your Oaths and Contracts. Again, Sir, we muſt ſuppoſe you to be a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Creature; and if ſo, we muſt alſo conclude you ought to have ſubmitted to Reaſon, that you might have, at leaſt have had the reputation of a Man, and not be ſignalized with the Character of a filthy Monſtrous Beaſt. Hence it is that Tyrants, in ſacred Writ, are called Beaſts, becauſe they will not ſubmit to,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56278:80"/>
nor be governed by the Rules of right Reaſon. In the laſt place, Sir, other Men may in their Oaths and Contracts have an Eye to their Profit, but you ought to have had an Eye to your Honour, and to have had an eſpecial regard thereof. Now what can be more Diſhonourable in a King, than to break his Word, falſifie his Faith, and violate his Contract? And was not your Word, Faith and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract confirmed by a ſolemn Oath?</p>
               <p n="3">3. There was a third Doctrine that was much promoted by your Conſpirators, that although Kings ſhould be ſtrictly bound to ſtand to their Contracts and their Oaths; yet if they were induced to make a Contract, and to take an Oath in things wherein they were not well informed, or if the Contract and Oath do contain things too much derogating, or diminiſhing their Juriſdiction or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity Royal, or if they have made a Promiſe that may be prejudicial to their Greatneſs, they may then lawfully break their Contract, Faith and Oath.</p>
               <p>This Doctrine was very induſtriouſly ſpread about by your Party, eſpecially by your Jeſuits and your Jeſuited Papiſts, and Paſſive Obedience Men. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, Sir, your Conſpirators repreſented your underſtanding to be but of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Standard, and to be of the ſame Scantling with their Honeſty. Give me leave to ask you this one fair Queſtion, Was you not well informed what you were to do, and what you did promiſe to do when you took the Coronation Oath to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Proteſtant Religion, and preſerve and maintain the Laws of the Realm, and by them to govern this great People you took the Charge of? Can any Man think, Sir, that you ſhould be the only Man that was Ignorant of that which all the Nation knew, and what your Grand-father, Father and Brother had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you? Where, Sir, was the Diſhonour or Blemiſh that might fall upon you, if you had kept your Oath, and made the Laws of the Land the Rule of your Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? If you had been a good King, you would have delighted to have been bound by the Laws of the Land, and have rejoyced the Hearts of the People of <hi>England;</hi> and then you would not have at this time have been obliged to <hi>France</hi> for your Subſiſtance.</p>
               <p>But, Sir, God in his juſt Judgment gave you up to believe theſe lies, and therefore you violated thoſe Laws by which you were Sworn to govern, to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie your Popiſh Hellborn Crew; they have got you to themſelves. We have a King that thinks it no Blemiſh to his Regal Authority, to maintain and keep our Laws, he judges it no Diſhonour to preſerve the Liberties of his People, and their Honours and Eſtates: You have the reward of your Unrighteouſneſs, I wiſh you much Joy of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some of the Doctors and Caſuiſts of your Synagogue of <hi>Rome</hi> ſay, that Princes who may diſpenſe with others may give a ſufficient Diſpenſation to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo revoke their Contracts and break their Oaths; for that they have Might, and Power, and Authority; there is no Law, no Judge that can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel them to keep their Oaths, and obſerve their Contracts.</p>
               <p>It is manifeſt that you did take upon you to diſpenſe with others, and to give your ſelf a Diſpenſation too; and we own that we were not then in a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to call you to an Account; but you were Admoniſhed very often by the beſt and greateſt of your Subjects, to reform all that was amiſs: But after all this
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56278:81"/>
Admonition, you did remain incorrigible; then what could we do but make your Actions, Cruelties and Tyrannies, and Perjury known to the World. And we implored the Aid and Help not of the <hi>French</hi> King, but <hi>William</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who came and ſuppreſſed you as an incorrigible Oppreſſor and Tyrant. And your Party appearing bare-faced to murther our King, and invade the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with a Foreign Force, in order to enſlave us, will be treated as Villains and Common Rogues, and receive the juſt recompence of Reward for all their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Conſpiracies againſt our King, and the well eſtabliſhed Government of the Kingdom, and the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
               <p>To conclude this point, How deteſtable and odious hath your Perjury made you, it hath excluded you from that great Honour to which you arrived, and it hath removed you from your native Country; in a word it hath clothed you with ſo much infamy, that it is impoſſible for you to attain that Honour, Power and Authority, and Majeſty you have loſt? And therefore it is highly unreaſonable for you, or your Conſpirators ever to attempt your Reſtauration.</p>
               <p>2. As your Perjur is an argument why it is not only impoſſible for you to be reſtored, and folly for you to attempt it, ſo in the ſecond place we are Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants; And what can a Popiſh Apoſtate do at the head of a Proteſtant Intereſt? The Popiſh Queen <hi>Mary</hi> ſhe no ſooner obtained the Crown, by a Proteſtant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, but ſhe deſtroyed that very Intereſt by which ſhe was advanced to the Throne. This we well remember, Sir; and we need not burn our Fingers again the third time. Suppoſe, Sir, that we ſhould have ſo little ſenſe as to try you once more, and ſhould ſucceed; What Monſters muſt we appear to the World, a Body of Proteſtants with a Popiſh Head? This doth much aſtoniſh me, that our little Prick-ear'd Prieſts of the Church of <hi>England</hi> have ſo much admired your Cauſe, and pleaded it with ſuch earneſtneſs; when as they cannot but conclude that you muſt of neceſſity deal by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as you would with an impudent Harlot. Your Brother was careleſs in the maintenance of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, becauſe he was a Papiſt, though a looſe one: And can we otherwiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude but you who have at all times, and in all places whereever you have come, ſhewed your ſelf a bigotted Papiſt, will not only diſcountenance the Proteſtant Religion, but deſtroy it with all that Zeal that is conſiſtent with the Principles of a perverſe Member of the Romiſh Synagogue. You in the time of your ſhort Tyranny made a ſad Havock with the Proteſtant Religion; and can we expect better uſuage from you, ſeeing you having Seven Devils more within you rage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the Proteſtant Intereſt than you had before you left us.</p>
               <p>What I ſay to you in this particular, I ſpeak not without Witneſs, for it is moſt certain that you have, and do to this very day entertain a very great averſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to any Man that bears the name of a Proteſtant. Therefore ſince by your late behaviour, to thoſe whoſe Principles have led them to eſpouſe your Intereſt, and have followed you into <hi>France,</hi> if they have any Senſe of their <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and of the Proteſtant Religion, will abhor the thoughts of your return hither: For if you appear ſo violent againſt our Religion now you are under ſo great an eſtate of Sufferings; What will your declared Hatred be againſt Proteſtants here in <hi>England,</hi> if we ſhould admit you to reign over us? For if
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56278:81"/>
you can preſume to that degree of Malice, as to deny your Proteſtant Tools your Grace and Favour at St. <hi>Germains;</hi> What can we that are Proteſtants ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from you whenever you ſhall return? Do you think that any of us ſhould be ſo ſtupid to expect fair Quarter from you, ſince your very Religion lays you under the neceſſity of Converting us with a Fagot, and bringing us to your Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience with the dint of a Dagger? Nay, Sir, your Paſſive Obedience Curs fare not much better, though they ſaved you from your being proſecuted for your being deeply intereſted in the Popiſh Plot, and from being excluded from the Succeſſion to the Imperial Crown of this Realm, and alſo from being beaten out of the Kingdom by the late Duke of <hi>MONMO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TH.</hi> What reaſon than have we not to believe that you will not only in general invade the Proteſtant Religion, but alſo once again attempt the depreſſing the Church of <hi>England?</hi> In your ſhort Reign you ſent Seven Biſhops to the <hi>Tower;</hi> but if ever you ſhould return I will not excuſe the whole Twenty Six from being more hardly uſed. Upon which conſideration I will appeal then, Sir, to your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the Judgment of your Friends here, or thoſe with you at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> whether or no it is impoſſible for you to gain ſo great a Point as to be received again as a King? And whether it would not be the greateſt Folly or Madneſs in you, or any of your Party to attempt it? For have you any that are with you, that are Proteſtants, upon a Principle of Conſcience, How have you uſed and treated them (and if they have no better uſage from you ſince they follow you in their Afflictions, and are contented to ſhare with you in your Hardſhips) as not to enjoy the Liberty of ſerving God according to their Dictates of their own Conſcience? How muſt it fare with them if you ſhould arrive to that State and Condition, in which you ſhould ſtand in no need of them? And if ſo, What can we expect from you that have hated your Perſon, and do hunt down your Cauſe and Intereſt out of the Nation? Therefore the Duty that we owe to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and the Affection and Zeal we have for the Proteſtant Religion, will oblige us to purſue you as a Murderer, and an Aſſaſſin of the People of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and a Traytor to the Nation; and thoſe who ſhall be found fighting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your Banner will be uſed as <hi>Banditti</hi> and <hi>Robbers,</hi> and Proteſtants that ſhall not have the benefit of Repentance.</p>
               <p>3. Conſider we are <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men; and that very Conſideration might ſatisfie any Man that will but conſult his Reaſon of the impoſſibility of your being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to your pretended Right, and of the folly of your many attempt, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereunto. Had your Intereſt been an <hi>Engliſh</hi> intereſt, than your Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators might have had ſome colour for their attempt of this Nature; but your Intereſt is a <hi>French</hi> Interſt, and therefore your Intereſt that you have eſpouſed is incompatible, or inconſiſtent with your being reſtored. Here are two Points that muſt be conſidered. 1. That your Intereſt is a <hi>French</hi> Intereſt. 2. That a <hi>French</hi> Intereſt is not conſiſtent with your Endeavours after a Reſtoration; and both theſe Points fairly proved will juſtifie the refuſal of the Kingdom of <hi>Englands</hi> admitting you to act, and execute the Office of a King here again amongſt us.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:56278:82"/>
1. Your Intereſt is not an <hi>Engliſh</hi> but a <hi>French</hi> Intereſt; for as you followed your loving and kind Brother in moſt of his Vertues, ſo you perſued the ſame Intereſt that he purſued: For was not the Intereſt of your Brother, and the Intereſt of the <hi>French</hi> King and yours inſeperably united? Knowing (ſaith your <hi>Quondam</hi> Secretary) the Intereſt of our King, and in a more particular manner of my immediate Maſter the Duke, and his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, to be ſo inſeperably united; that it was impoſſible to divide them without deſtroying them all. Again his Majeſty [the <hi>French King]</hi> was pleaſed to give Order to ſignifie to his R. H. my Maſter, that his Majeſty was fully ſatisfied of his R. H's good Intentions towards him, and that he eſteemed both their Intereſts but as one and the ſame, and that my Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> and the Parliament were both looked upon as very unuſeful to their Intereſts. And again Father <hi>Ferier</hi> begged his R. H. to propoſe to his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty what he thought neceſſary for his own Concern, and the advantage of Religion; and his Majeſty would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly do all that he could to advance both, or either of them.—I commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated it to his R. H. to which his R. H. commanded me to anſwer, as I did the <hi>29th</hi> of the ſame Month. That his R. H. was very ſenſible of his Moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Majeſty's Friendſhip, and that he would labour to cultivate it with all the good Offices he was capable of doing his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty. That he was fully convinced that their Intereſts were both one. That my Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> and the Parliament were not only unuſeful, but dangerous both to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and therefore it was neceſſary they ſhould do all they could to diſſolve it.—I did communicate this Deſign of mine to Monſieur <hi>Ravigney,</hi> who agreed with me that it would be the greateſt Advantage to his Maſter, to have the Duke's Power and Credit ſo far Advanced.—Again, If we can advance the Duke's Intereſt one ſtep forward, we ſhall put him out of the reach of Chance for ever.—Then would Catholicks be at reſt, and his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty's Intereſt ſecured with us in <hi>England,</hi> beyond all apprehenſions whatſoever.—Our prevailing in theſe things would give the greateſt blow to the Proteſtant Religion here, that ever it received from his Birth.—If the Duke ſhould once get above them (after all the Tricks they have plaied with him) they are not ſure he will totally forget the uſage he hath had at their Hands: For my part (ſaith he) I can ſcarce believe my ſelf awake, or the thing real, when I think on a Prince in ſuch an Age, as we live in, to be converted to ſuch a degree of Zeal and Piety, as not to regard any thing in the World in compariſon of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Diſcoveries of your Old Servant Mr. <hi>Coleman;</hi> but to rivet the Matter, I pray, conſider what Diſcoveries you were pleaſed to make of the Union of your Intereſt with that of the <hi>French King,</hi> which, Sir, will put the Matter out of diſpute. Give me leave to put you in mind of your Letter you wrote to the <hi>French King's</hi> Confeſſour, wherein you were pleaſed to own that the Intereſts of the <hi>French King</hi> and yours were ſo clearly linck'd together, that thoſe that oppoſed the one ſhould be looked on as Enemies to the other; and that the <hi>French King</hi> had told you that he was of the Opinion, that neither the Lord <hi>Arlington,</hi> nor the Parliament were in his Intereſt, nor yours.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:56278:82"/>
2. As it is as clear as the Day that your Intereſt is not an <hi>Engliſh</hi> but a <hi>French</hi> Intereſt; ſo now I muſt tell you in the ſecond place, that your Intereſt being a <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, it will render your return impoſſible, and the attempt in order to it very fooliſh and irrational. You know that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation is never ſafe, unleſs a check be put upon the growing Greatneſs of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore do but obſerve the Addreſs of the Houſe of Commons, <hi>March</hi> 10. 1676, they put the King your Brother in mind of the great Danger that the Nation was expoſed to, by reaſon of the growth of the French King's Power and Greatneſs. Now any Man that is in the Intereſt of the French King, his Intereſt is no ways reconcileable to the Intereſt of <hi>England.</hi> 1. As to its Peace. 2. As to its Trade. And the Conſequence of both theſe are the Riches of the Nation, which muſt be conſumed by a Prince that is of an Intereſt different from that of the People, 'tis true the preſent War with <hi>France</hi> hath proved very charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Nation; but here is our Happineſs that we have a King that advanceth the Intereſt of our Trade, his People and He go Hand in Hand, Their Intereſts are the ſame with His, and His the ſame with Theirs; which to me is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that when it ſhall have pleaſed God, by His Arms, to reduce the French King to Reaſon, that then no Nation under the Heavens can or will be more happy than the Engliſh Nation: But if a Prince ſhall, inſtead of purſuing the Intereſt of his People, purſue their Deſtruction, by ſetting up and advancing the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of a Foreign Power, his Government cannot ſtand. This, Sir, was that which loſt you your Crown, And can you then expect by that Intereſt to regain the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> by which you ſtrangely loſt it? Therefore, to conclude this Head, let not your Conſpirators think that it is either probable or poſſible that ever the People of <hi>England</hi> will ever be brought into a French Intereſt, or ever admit you to reſume the Throne and Government, ſince that you purely loſt it for the ſake of that Intereſt.</p>
               <p>Your Scoundrel Abettors here at Home, are ſuch a ſort of Animals that the Reformed Nations Abroad are at a ſtand, and cannot tell what to make of them, their Carriages of late Years have been ſo unaccountable; and ſince it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to put it into the Hearts of moſt of the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> though of the Romiſh Communion, heartily to embrace the late Revolution in <hi>England,</hi> as the laſt Effort for the Common Liberty of <hi>Europe,</hi> and have entered into the ſtricteſt Alliance with our King (though of a different Religion) to ſupport it; it looks like a Dream to meet with Men that call themſelves Engliſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants embarqued in your Intereſt, in oppoſition to the Intereſt of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Countrey.</p>
               <p>A little Prieſt of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in a Sermon of his on the Day your Father made his <hi>Exit,</hi> was pleaſed to threaten us with an endleſs War that would be entailed on the Nation; he is a mighty Votary for your Cauſe and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, notwithſtanding his Oath to King <hi>William</hi> to the contrary. But, Sir, a thouſand ſuch Fellows can never reconcile your Intereſt with that of <hi>England,</hi> nor would your Reſtoration put an end to his ſuppoſed War; for it is not reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to imagine that ſo many Noblemen and Gentlemen who have aſſociated, and by their Aſſociation have engaged to ſupport the Intereſt and Cauſe of our
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56278:83"/>
King, will tamely ſubmit to your Reſtoration: Or that King <hi>William</hi> will ever abandon his Throne, or that its poſſible that the Common Cauſe of <hi>Europe</hi> will ever be ſuffered to ſink in ſuch a manner as to comply with the Pride and Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your Self, or of him whoſe Cauſe you have eſpouſed, and whoſe Intereſt is the very ſame with yours: When you were upon the Throne your Aim was to deſtroy the Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> but we have been too many for you, and the Throne is filled up with one that will maintain and ſupport our Intereſt, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the vain Efforts of your Crew both at Home and Abroad to the contrary. And therefore that Loggerhead of a Cathedral Prieſt hath not made one ſingle Convert to your Cauſe and Intereſt, by the Noiſe he made of diſputed Titles and endleſs Wars. I will obſerve this to you that the Raſcal hath more Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than Learning or Honeſty, but what can we expect of an Apoſtate?</p>
               <p>4. We are Freemen, and therefore we can never be ſuppoſed ever to admit you, who have always been a Perſon of Arbitrary Principles, to govern this Nation. You cannot but remember that the Engliſh Nation hath a very great Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for its Liberties; and that is the Government it ſelf, with a good King at the head thereof, and that is our preſent Happineſs; for our King Rules not upon the ſame Terms as your Brother of <hi>France</hi> doth; for he by Force Uſurps that ſhare which his People ought to have in the Government, and for ſeveral Ages paſt hath been in poſſeſſion of an Arbitrary Power, (which yet no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription can make Legal) and he exerciſeth it over the Perſons and Eſtates of his People in a moſt Tyrannical manner: And this your loving and kind Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and you aimed at, Witneſs your Diſpenſing Power that you took upon you when you aſcended the Throne. But our King hath ſo ordered it, that his Subjects ſhall retain their Proportion in the Legiſlature; the very meaneſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner of <hi>England</hi> is repreſented in Parliament, and is a Party to thoſe Laws by which our King is Sworn to govern himſelf and his People. 'Tis true you Swore, but you made no Conſcience of your Oath, nor did you in the leaſt boggle at the Violation of our Laws; you hated that way of Government which you had ſolemnly promiſed to maintain and defend, Witneſs the Names you uſed to give the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi> Now according to the Laws of the Realm no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is raiſed but by common Conſent: But you were pleaſed to raiſe Money upon the People by your Proclamation. The very Day after you had promiſed to invade no Mans Property: Now no Man is for Life, Limb, Goods, or Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, at the Sovereigns Direction; but how ſoon it would have been had not a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod been put to your Tyranny? For your Sycophant Paraſites were very zealous to have delivered up thoſe Priviledges in to your Hands, judging it would not be well with <hi>England</hi> till you were as Abſolute as the Monſter of <hi>France,</hi> by which we might eaſily underſtand your Intentions. For, Sir, who knows not that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of a Prince is beſt known either by thoſe that are about him, and moſt Favour with him, or by the current of his own Actions? Thoſe who were neareſt to you, and moſt your Favourites, were your Iriſh and French Courtiers, and your Popiſh Prieſts and Prelates, who theſe Men ſtood affected to. Your Diſcretio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Diſpotick Power can never be forgotten: No Man but may remember, that in their common Diſcourſe were for advancing your Will and Pleaſure over
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56278:83"/>
your Subjects to be equal with that of the King of <hi>France</hi> is over his. This was but a Copy which thoſe Villains had induſtriouſly taken from your own Words and Actions. In <hi>Scotland</hi> you did publickly ſet up for that Power, and openly declared you would be obeyed without reſerve.</p>
               <p>The attempt you and your Conſpirators made in the time of the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor <hi>Hyde</hi> upon our Liberties, is never to be forgetten; a Bill was prepared to enable the King your Brother in the time of any interval of Parliament, to raiſe what Money he pleaſed upon an extraordinary occaſion, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> War was pretended to be. This had taken its much deſired effect, had not that Lord Chancellor been awakened by an intimate Friend of his, who, underſtanding what was doing in the Houſe of Commons, came to him and ſhewed him what the Conſequences were which ſuch an unheard thing would produce; and he uſing one Argument above all the reſt, in telling him he came to his Honour and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by the Gown, and not by the Sword; and if that Bill paſſed, he adviſed him to conſider what his Gown, or all the Lawyers Gowns in <hi>England</hi> were worth, which that Lord Chancellor, though one of the Actors with you to enſlave the Nation, being a Man of Senſe, had that Honor as to think it no Diſhonor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat from that Deviliſh Invention, which he to comply with your Ambition and Pride had ſet on foot to deſtroy us at once: So that Bill, though once read in the Houſe for enabling the King, your Brother, to raiſe Money at pleaſure, was by the Providence of God, and the Prudence of that Noble Penitent Lord drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo far, as that it dwindled into a Bill of 75000 <hi>l.</hi> not exceeding a Months Tax. No doubt but you had procured this Bill to be dreſſed in the <hi>French Mode</hi> for emergent Occaſions; yet had it paſſed in the ſame manner as you and your Accomplices deſigned, there would not have wanted emergent Occaſions, and extraordinary Services to have given Colour for keeping that Power on foot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Dooms Day in the Afternoon.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> King, whoſe Example you followed in this particular, got his Power by ſuch a villainous Stratagem; but he hath not been at leiſure yet to call his Parliament to diſpute that Point. I queſtion not but that your loving Brother and you would have found other Matters of moment, to have diverted you from that way of raiſing Money; ſo <hi>England</hi> muſt have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken leave of Parliaments for ever, and we muſt have ſubmitted all we had to your <hi>French</hi> Diſcretion. But through the Bleſſing of Heaven, and the Care of our Legiſlators, we are delivered not only from your Government and your intended <hi>French</hi> way of Governing; for we continue to have the ſame Right (modeſtly underſtood) in our Propriety that our Prince hath in his Royalty, and in all Caſes where the King himſelf is concerned we have our juſt Remedy, as againſt any private Perſon in the Nation, in the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter-hall,</hi> or in the High Court of Parliament; for his Prerogative is not like that you would have uſurped, but what the Law hath only determined. His great Seal, which is the legitimate Stamp of his Royal Will and Pleaſure, yet it is no longer currant than upon the Tryal it is found to be according to Law and Juſtice. The King cannot commit any Man by his own particular Warrant, he cannot be himſelf a Witneſs in any Cauſe whatever, tho your Brother would have been one againſt me. The Ballance of publick Juſtice being ſo delicate, that not the Head only
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56278:84"/>
but even the Breath of the King would turn the Scale; nothing is left to the Win of the King, but every thing is ſubject to his legal Authority; by which means it follows, that as he can do no Wrong, nor can he receive Wrong. But you by your Diſpenſing Power put your ſelf in a ſtate of Wronging the Nation, and deſtroying your ſelf and Government; but had you kept to the Meaſures of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> King, you might have remained to this Day to have been the only intelligent Ruler over a rational People, your Perſon had been Sacred and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable, and whatever Exceſs had been committed in your Reigh, would not have been imputed to you as being free from the Neceſſity and Temptations: Your Miniſters would have been only accountable for all, and muſt have An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered it at their Perils. You had a vaſt Revenue, and if any emergency of Affair ſhould have appeared, you had at your Call a number of Men to have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed with, a ſupply would have been readily granted. You were the Fountain of Honour, the diſpoſer of many profitable Places both in Church and State; but this would not ſerve your turn, for you would not be abridged the Power of injuring the People of <hi>England,</hi> but againſt all Law invaded our Rights, and deſigned nothing ſo much as enſlaving us and our Poſterity for ever: And we that have taſted ſo much of the ſweetneſs of Liberty, and on the other hand have ſmarted under your ſhort, but cruel Tyranny will never be intangled again with the French Popiſh Yoke of Bondage, but ſtand in defence of the King we have choſen, and the Liberty we have recovered as long as we have a Being in this World. Therefore conſider with your ſelf the impoſſibility of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, to that Government you abuſed, to the Adminiſtration of thoſe Laws you violated, to a Nation that you made a Field of Blood; and if you had remained, for ought I know, <hi>England</hi> might have been a Howling Wilderneſs. In fine, then I am ſure if you ſhould make any attempt to return it will be in vain, and appear very rediculous.</p>
               <p>5. We have Sworn Allegiance to King <hi>William,</hi> who is of the ſame Religion and Intereſt with us, who delivered us out of your Hands and the Hands of your villainous Conſpirators, and hath fixed us upon thoſe Foundations, againſt which <hi>France, Rome,</hi> nor <hi>Hell</hi> ſhall prevail; he hath ſecured us, our Liberties, Laws and Religion; he hath brought himſelf and Government to that Perfection, notwithſtanding the vexatious War which lies hard upon us, that he is capable of doing good to all Mankind, and he hath totally diſabled himſelf from doing hurt to any; he wants not the French King's Purſe, nor his Friendſhip; he wants not his Intereſt, for his Intereſt is his Peoples, and his Peoples his, by which they are ſo united, that the attempts of your Scoundrel Crew for your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration will be in vain; the Hearts of the Nation are ſet againſt you, and for your perfidious dealing both in Church and State the People of <hi>England</hi> will truſt you no more.</p>
               <p>Sir, We have Sworn Allegiance to this King we choſe in your ſtead, and we are bound to ſtand by him; our choiſe of him was from a Principle of Love to God and the Proteſtant Religion which he hath aſſerted. You kept not your Faith with us, and therefore our Allegiance ceaſed to you, your Actions have been very plain and open, and ſo pernitious that it was a Wonder of Wonders,

Have you not been Judged by the Lords and Commons of <hi>England,</hi> and Condemned? Was not your Reign ſhort? And hath not another taken your Office? In time, Sir, the Judgment may be compleated upon you. There is of your Iſſue that have had no Hand in our Miſeries, and for this Cauſe our Eyes are ſet upon them for good, and we ſhall pray for their long Life: But as for you, that God would cloth you with Shame and Confuſion of Face; and that he would upon the Head of our Proteſtant King let the Crown long floriſh: And I do not queſtion but God will hear the Prayers of his Faithful Subjects, and will by his means bring the Nation to ſuch a Settlement that our Allegiance will be firm to him and his Succeſſors, notwithſtanding all thoſe villainous Attempts that you and that Monſter of Mankind your Brother of <hi>France,</hi> by his and your Traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Accomplices, have made to deprive us of ſo great a Bleſſing. Which brings me to a Sixth Conſideration.</p>
               <p>6. The laſt Reaſon I ſhall give you, why it will be impoſſible for you to return to the Adminiſtration of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, and that all Attempts of that nature will be in vain, becauſe of your late barbarous and villainous Attempt you by your Conſpirators have made upon the Perſon of our King, and your purpoſe of backing that intended Murder by an unnatural Invaſion; you had ſome that pittied you, but now our Hearts are ſhut up againſt you, and are hardned againſt all your Curſed Adherents: For now your Plot is diſcovered, and it is a Plot and a Villainous One, nothing can be plainer; no Man of Common Underſtanding but muſt ſee your Conſpiracy to bring in Popery and Slavery, and to deſtroy the Proteſtant Religion and the Liberties of <hi>England.</hi> We know, Sir, the Doctrine of your Popiſh and Non-juring Prieſts too well, and your wicked Practices; and we are now aſſured that you will not ſtick at any thing that may bring your wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Deſigns about. You muſt excuſe me if I am plain with you, I would not aſperſe you with hard Words if they were not very true, I ſhould not have been ſo Hot if you had not been concerned in the late wicked Deſign of murthering our King, but if you had ſucceeded it would have been no more than you did to your Loving and Kind Brother; but all this as well as the other is owing to you and your Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Traiterous Crew, who have debauched Mens Underſtandings, overturned all Morals, and deſtroyed all Divinity. What ſhall I ſay of you and your villain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Party? What is your Charity ſuch as to deſtroy Kings? And where was the Humility of inſulting over the Nation? The Myſtery of Iniquity is revealed, and

               <p>To conclude this Memorial, Sir, give me leave to tell you that I have thus f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> what Difficulty the <hi>Dutch,</hi> both in your Brothers and your Reign: We ſee your Brother and you abandon the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> now our King, in compliance with his and the Nations Enemies. How can any Man think upon the <hi>French</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations and Cruelties exerciſed at Sea upon the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> without Regret? Call to mind your notorious Treacheries in that Affair: Remember the conſtant Irregularities and Injuſtice from term to term of thoſe who ſhould have adminiſtred Juſtice between King and People: Remember the ſearch you made throughout the whole Kingdom to find Men of Arbitrary Principles, that would bow the Knee to <hi>Baal</hi> in order to their being promoted to all publick Commiſſions and Employments, and diſgracing and diſplacing all thoſe that durſt, in ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal a Depravation, be honeſt and faithful in their Truſt and Offices. We ſaw to our great Grief the Defection of conſiderable Perſons, both Male and Female, to the Popiſh Religion, as if they enter'd by Couples, Clean and Unclean, into the Ark of that Curſed Synagogue, not more in order to their Salvation than for their Temporal Advantage and Safety. Sir, the State of <hi>Ireland</hi> managed by your Brother and you would require a Volume to repreſent it; and in your Time we could not but obſerve that all your Affairs and Councils in the Nation tended to a Popiſh Revolution. And by the Foreſight and Civility of the Man of Sin, there was an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cardinal prepared, like Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> to give us Abſolution, Benediction, and to receive us to the Obedience of the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> It is true your Conſpiracy had taken effect had you not met with many Diſappointments; but the laſt Diſappointment was the overturn of all your Deſigns at once, which was occaſioned by the Arrival of the Prince of <hi>Orange:</hi> Guilt made you to flee. The Senſe the Nation had of your wicked Intentions, againſt our Laws and Liberties, cauſed the People of <hi>England</hi> to make choice of our Deliverer to reign over us: He is anointed our King, and as God hath ſet a Crown of pure Gold upon his Head, ſo we queſtion not but the ſame God will ſatisfy him with long Life and Happineſs, and that he will give him the Spirit of Wiſdom, Knowledge, Zeal and Faithfulneſs, to do what in him lies to the bringing on the New Heavens and the New Earth wherein Righteouſneſs and Peace ſhall dwell, by repairing the Breaches and decayed Places that you have made and cauſed amongſt us. And from hence, Sir, remember that though <hi>Hand join in Hand, yet the Wicked ſhall not go unpuniſhed;</hi> they are Gods own Words, who hath alſo declared with the greateſt Solemnity, that <hi>there ſhall be no Peace to the Wicked,</hi> Iſa. 57.21. You have leiſure to conſider of theſe things; and ſo Farewell.</p>
